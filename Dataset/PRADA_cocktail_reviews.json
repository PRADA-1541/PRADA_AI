My friends mostly liked it (although a little on the sweet side) but everyone agreed that it still didn't pack much of a punch. The high rating is for a simple yet decent punch that can be thrown together in a pinch w\/a few inexpensive ingredients. Lots of potential for it to be doctored up w\/different fun ingredients. "

It's now a standard at my bar set-up, along with other pop & mixers, beer and wine. I split it into two batches -- one spiked and one virgin, and don't bother with the punch bowl, I just use large pitchers. My only warning is to pour the pop in small batches and don't stir it too much, as the carbonation seems to react with the juice concentrate and really fizzes up a lot. I had a sticky mess to clean up the first time -- learned my lesson after that. Great punch - definitely recommend! "

Also add a few ounces of fresh orange juice. After blending without ice, pour into a pitcher and keep in the refrigerator. Then when making a drink just add ice to the blender and whatever amount you want of the mix. Great for unexpected guests or just me enjoying the evening garden! "

But the flavor was actually really great. Might try some agave nectar next time. Also, a squeeze of fresh lime juice and maybe a splash of OJ really brightens it up and it's so much better than squeezing a million fresh limes for each drink! I've stocked up on a big quality bottle of the tequila I prefer, a big bottle of Cointreau and a few containers of brand name limeade concentrate, for the ease of it. I'm always on the front porch now that the weather's warm and it's always classy to be able to offer a cold drink. If you're not a margarita snob, definitely try this easy, yummy recipe! This is my go-to margarita recipe if I'm feeling lazy. :) "

The only difference is simply limeade uses sugar instead of high fructose corn sugar used in most frozen limeade. Either way, these are great. Also, you can splurge and use Cointreau instead of Triple Sec for a \"Deluxe\" version of this cocktail. "

If I want to make strawberry, I use the frozen sliced strawberries (for smoothies) and cut down on the ice. And if you are wanting to make a \"kid\" batch, just substitute the tequila and triple sec with orange juice. They love to have a cocktail too! "

I use 4 oz Tequila, 1\/3 can frozen lime aid, sugar to taste up to 1 tablespoon, splash of triple sec (or none), 2 cups of ice. Place all in that order in a blender.

It was so easy and the margaritas are wonderful!!! I did not fill the blender with ice all the way to the top with the first batch (was afraid it would overflow), and the margaritas were too strong. The following batches were perfect. Recommend making before the guests arrive (especially if your blender is really loud), put in a plastic jug and put in the ice in your beverage tub. It keeps better than you would expect. Make sure you buy enough limeade! Would recommend to calculate 1 batch per every 4 guests, more if there are no other beverages (we used up 4 batches for 18 people, despite offering also wine, beer, and non-alcoholic drinks) "

What I now do is use the can of limeade; then use 1\/2 can water; 1\/2 can - ok - maybe a little more of tequila; almost 1\/2 a can of triple sec or a good Orange liquire; then I mix in a blender with no ice. Pour into a salt rimmed glass over ice; and then add 1 shot of Ameratto to the glass. WOW- it sure does knock it up a noch and is super good. Thanks so much for this recipe. - PS - you can use Kosher Salt instead of 'Margarita Salt' its easier to find and cheaper. "

Tired of the same old pizza and cake routine, I decided to make fajitas and margaritas, so that all the grown-ups could enjoy themselves too! This margarita recipe was fantastic and a hit. I followed the recipe exactly and added some fresh lime juice and an ounce of OJ for those that wanted margaritas on the rocks. I also made several frozen batches with whole fresh mango chunks blended in, finished with a Chambord float on top, like one reviewer mentioned. It was amazing! The margaritas went well with the Avocado, Tomato and Mango Salsa on this site. Thanks for the great recipe. "

I enjoyed this slushy, slightly tart, and just-sweet-enough concoction with tortillas and salsa. It was better than the restaurant margaritas I've tried. It was tastier than a prepackaged mixer without any extra work. Omit the tequila and triple sec and add a splash of orange juice for an alcohol-free treat that can be enjoyed by everyone! "

The secret is filling the blender with ice, and then the addition of the frozen limeade concentrate makes it the perfect consistency for a blended margarita. This tasted authentic, and exactly like the drinks I have ordered and enjoyed from Mexican restaurants. I am hooked on this recipe now! Great, delicious, easy to make, and much cheaper than a premade mix - I'll never make margaritas any other way again. "

I bought a margaritaville frozen concoction machine recently and wanted to take it down to my sister's for our annual 4th of July party at her house by the beach. I searched for a recipe and found this one. I am so glad I picked this one, because these were a huge hit at the party! I ended up being the bartender for the night and made batch after batch of these delicious drinks. Some people thought the limeade a bit too tangy so I used 1\/2 the can of limeade and squeezed a tad of fresh lime in the mix. They were perfect!!

Freeze the watermelon and add with the ice when making these margaritas. Freezing is key to keeping the drink a good thick frozen consistancy. Also, you can de-seed then puree and freeze in ice cube trays for later use. Just pop them in a zipper bag to keep fresh tasting. These will be the hit at your BBQ or next party! "

However, I use a 12 oz can of limeade and mix in the tequila and triple sec on a 2:1 ratio. Depending on how strong your like your tequila I've made them with 1\/2 C tequila, 1\/4 C triple sec all the way up to a full cup of tequila. "

In my former life I spend many, many years bartending in a popular restaurant know for it's signature drinks. Despite that experience I struggled to duplicate a decent margarita at home. I didn't have the secret spice mix, none of the (expensive) mixes out there even came close, and messing with all of those limes and sugar was, well, a mess! Search no more folks, this is sooo easy and makes the perfect Margarita to boot. Ialways add a splash of O.J. to the blender. To make it \"golden\" sub Gran Marnier or Cointrau (sp?) or a combo of both for the Triple Sec. In the summer I often replace half of the ice with frozen chunks of watermelon and it is devine! If you prefer your margarita on the rocks, cut the recipe with 1\/2 h20, put in a shaker with ice, shake shake shake and pour into your ice filled glass. "

I made one batch with limeade (I cut the 12-oz can in half lengthwise and stuck the second half in a freezer bag, back in the freezer!) and used 1\u00bd or 2 trays of ice cubes... Well, they were a little strong! The second batch somehow turned out stronger... Nice to drink while watching our daughter playing in her wading pool in 90-degree weather in early May! I also made a batch with pink lemonade instead of limeade and it turned out wonderful as well. Seriously, thanks so much for sharing this recipe, Katherine! "

Only difference, we've always used a teaspoon of sugar or two instead of triple sec - not a big difference. Also, we usually call them \"drunk margaritas,\" because you can make them well, even when you're drunk. Since we use the 6 oz. can of limeade, you just dump that over the ice in the blender, then fill the limeade can with tequila then add the sugar. Trust me, these are fool-proof, and you really can make them perfectly even when you're drunk. (Though maybe you wouldn't really notice.) "

One quick tip for easy measuring that I use- I dump the can of frozen limeade in the blender, fill the limeade can 3\/4 full with tequilla and the remainder full (1\/4) with the triple sec, pour that in then fill the blender with ice. Turn on the blender and let the party begin! Much easier then using a measuring cup. If this is too strong then simply fill the can half way with tequilla and add triple sec to make the can 3\/4 full. "

I wasn't too sure about filling the blender with ice but if you don't you won't get the right consistency (slushy). I also measured the tequila and Triple Sec with a measuring cup to get it just right. Not too tart and not too sweet, they are very smooth, easy to make, and they kept well in the refrigerator as well. EVERYONE asked for the recipe. Perfect for a warm afternoon outside. "

But my sister in-law gave me this bottle of red wine that sat unused for over a year. But during the social isolation period of 2020, I figured what the $&@? I will make some sangria. So I had to use what I had in the house. Bourbon in place of brandy, lemonade mix (in a cup of water, used 1\/3 c in recipe) in place of frozen concentrate, and no soda water which I always thought watered it down anyway. Results.... amazing! A use of wine I can get behind. I added a tablespoon of sugar dissolved in a cup of the mix the next day, to break up the tartness from the lemon. If you prefer a sweeter sangria you will want to add some sweeter elements, this is bold, reminiscent of port. "

Even mis-reading the proportions and adding a little too much lemon juice didn't kill it - we just adjusted the other ingredients until it tasted good to us. YUM! This will definitely become a motorhoming staple. "

I use inexpensive red blend wines, doesn't matter what kind, they all come out great... I don't add the white sugar, you don't need to... and I use a single serve bottle of 7UP (instead of carbonated water) for the carbonation and sweetness and I add it right before serving... I also cut up all kinds of fruits to add, not just the orange, lemon, & lime as the recipe lists... I use apples, strawberries, peaches, etc... Again, it doesn't really matter... this recipe allows you the freedom to play around without screwing it up AT ALL... I will say making it the night before does seem to make a difference to the complexity of the flavors... But I've also made it and served it 15 minutes later because someone asked me to make 'that awesome sangria' and it's still fantastic!! "

Threw some frozen strawberries in too. Made it the day before (added the ginger ale just before serving). It was delicious... and dangerous! LOL! This stuff tastes like punch but packs quite a punch! I'll definitely make this again. Next time, I'll cut the lemons, limes, and oranges into smaller pieces... while they looked pretty in rounds, they made it difficult to put some fruit in to each person's glass, and the smaller fruit was stuck at the bottom of the pitcher. By cutting them smaller it will be easier to use a slotted spoon to put some fruit in each person's glass before\/after pouring. "

I used 2 bottles of semi-sweet red and 1 bottle sweet red wine (nothing fancy!) and halved the sugar. I let this sit overnight and added 2 cups of carbonated water (used my Soda Stream) in the morning. I tripled the recipe for approx. 15 people and this was a huge HIT. It was gone only halfway through the party and people were asking me to make more! The flavors and fruit come together beautifully in a rich, deep red color. I was not expecting this to be so strong though, you can't really taste how strong it is. Definitely a creeper! I think I could easily make this using half the triple sec and brandy and still have it taste delicious. I plan on adding more fresh fruit next time around. Great recipe! "

For the carbonated water, I used Topo Chico, a locally popular sparkling mineral water of Mexican origin. Since I was making enough for a big party, using a 3 gallon glass vessel, I made the \"base\" for this sangria, multiplying the recipe x3, to generously serve 25 guests. The \"base\" includes ALL ingredients EXCEPT the carbonated water, i.e. Topo Chico. To maximally maintain carbonation for each refill of the pitcher, I ladled one-third of the liquid \"base\" mixture (approximately 5 cups) into the pitcher, adding the slices of lime\/lemon\/orange, and 2 cups Topo Chico. To serve or refill each guest, a beverage wineglass was half-filled with ice. I did not garnish with maraschino cherries as I do NOT use these food aberrations. This beverage was a party hit, with many compliments and no left-overs. "

(YAY!) 2) we didn\u2019t have a regular brandy so I used Tuaca instead since it is made with Brandy, 3) I used a cheap red blend wine ($4.97\/bottle), 4) totally forgot to get the cherries, but it didn\u2019t affect the taste apparently!

I attempted a version with rum and was quickly told to stick to the brandy version. I cheat a bit and add the Costco brand sangria with sweet red wine since I prefer a sweeter version. I started with the original recipe and have tweaked it over the years with different flavored brandy i.e. peach, apricot, cherry, blackberry, you get the point. It\u2019s much better when you let it sit overnight. It\u2019s absolutely delicious and will sneak up on you if you\u2019re not careful. "

I checked out this recipe and decided to make it... I quadrupled the recipe to make 24 servings (2 (12-serving) batches). I followed the recipe closely MINUS the sugar and cherries. I also omitted the club soda\/ginger ale. I used Trader Joe's fresh-squeezed OJ. I also hand-squeezed 2 lemons and 2 limes per 12-serving batch; I do this because I find when you add lemons and limes sliced up, the rinds make the sangria bitter. I added fresh apples and oranges but I removed the orange rinds (same reason as mentioned above), as well as blueberries. Used Spanish table wine, triple sec and brandy, let the whole thing refrigerate for 2 days. Needless to say, every time I walked passed the bar, I watched the sangria container go down, down, down. People RAVED and said, \"Next year, you need to make more!\" A huge hit! I loved the addition of the lemonade concentrate. I used 1 can per 12-serving batch. There's enough sugar in that - you don't need to add more. YUM! I WILL be making this again! "

Cutting the rinds off the circles seemed good, and if the circles are cut into bite size pieces then you can serve by ladelling (ladeling?) out the sangria + fruit. Definitely recommend making the day before, for taste and then it gets cold in icebox. But fine with ice cubes also. Probably not as many circles as recipe calls for, are needed.

We used fresh squeezed juices and dialed back the sugar to about half what was called for. Next time we make it, we may try it without any sugar. Absolutely let this recipe sit in your fridge overnight and stir it every few hours to submerge the fruit that is on top. We tried it after making it and again the next day, and it was significantly better the next day. "

I left out the cherries, used less sugar and used the juice from fruit instead of concentrate and let it soak overnight.

I leave out the lemonade concentrate (as I usually don't have access to that, and Sangria from Spain or Mexico wouldn't have it in anyway). We lived in Mexico and EVERYONE loved this. The key is making it in advance so that the flavors really meld. I always make it at least the morning of the day before I intend to serve it. You can make it earlier than that, just don't add the fruit pieces until 24-36 hours before. When we lived in Mexico, I used Rioja wine to make it (a cheapish one as you don't need high quality wine in this mixed drink). In the U.S., I have used Cabernet as I was unable to find Rioja. I usually have Sprite and club soda on hand for people to add to it themselves. Some people don't want it watered down at all and some people prefer sweeter. "

I never use very expensive wines in this recipe (~$8 bottle), but I think the end result will depend on how sweet of a red wine you choose. This drink is STRONG. Definitely dilute with sparkling water as suggested. I'm a heavy wine drinker and I cannot handle more than 1-2 glasses of this at most. GREAT for summer dinner parties by the pool! "

It all fit in a really large pitcher that I have even doubling the fruit slices and the cherries you put in and I definitely made it the day before. Right before serving, I did add 1 can of cold diet ginger ale just to cut it a little bit (although it was great without it too because I had to try it!!) and also added frozen cherries as ice cubes in the glasses before pouring!

I followed the recipe to a T with 2 additions fresh cherries along with the marichino and I added New York black cherry seltzer with ginger ale and no sugar. I multiplied the recipe *4 and it was amazing. I tasted it when I put it together and the over night marinade is a must. The taste difference is night and day!! Follow the directions and you won't go wrong!! Thank you so much for the recipe! This is definite a recipe I'll keep doing. It would make my Spanish Grandma so happy if she was still here to enjoy. "

I let it sit over night and it was very tarty. I put club soda into it to see if it made a difference, it did not. I wasted a bottle of red wine. I would not be making this again.

        "Review":"This was absolutely delicious. I made this for the professional championship football game and all the guests, even the guys, loved it! I decided to make two separate batches. With the first (red sangria), I used merlot (you need a medium-bodied red wine), Christian Brothers brandy (cheap), and a Patron Orange Liqueur (you can find a cheaper one). For the second, I wanted to make a white sangria. With that, I used Reisling (instead of the red wine), Captain Morgan Spiced Rum (substitute for the brandy), and Peach Schapps (vs the orange liqueur). Per the recommendation of other reviewers, I omitted (or you can use half of) the sugar. I chilled in the refrigerator overnight BEFORE adding the fruit. I added the fruit a few hours before the guests would arrive (I added oranges, lemons, limes, grapes, strawberries, and apples). Again, absolutely delicious. I can't wait to have another event so I can try this one again. Don't hesitate to try this recipe (with my suggestions). Enjoy!!! P.S. If your containers are plastic and aren't stain-resistant, fruit will damage it if left in overnight (specifically oranges, lemons, and limes as they are acidic). Some plastic containers even discourage adding liquor above 7.5% for that same reason. I purchased glass, 2.5 gallon pitchers for this. Worth it!! "

I only make a few changes and it always turns out amazing and gets the whole family real drunk. What I do: 1. I don't care if the wine is dry or sweet, I just buy the cheapest stuff I can find that isn't boxed. I taste it. If its really sweet, I cut pack a bit on the orange juice. If it isn't so sweet I keep the OJ the same. 2. Since the first batch, I NEVER add cherries (just kinda tasted weird and added their syrup to the recipe) or lemons\/limes (too sour---I like to eat my fruit as I'm drinking the sangria)... 3. So I add more oranges and if I know it's all gonna be gone soon, I add apple slices (DO NOT add them if you aren't gonna be drinking it all the next day...cos the longer they are in there the slimier they get). 4.I also never add the sugar (it's sweet enough) or carbonated water (detracts from the taste\/my sweet buzz). Always, no mater how much you want to drink it now, wait til the next day to drink it. "

I make this quite often, here are my changes: No lemonade concentrate (ew), I squeeze a lemon and a lime instead. Instead of carbonated water (I just don't like it), I will use a splash of Sprite. I will juice oranges if I have them on hand, if not, then orange juice will do. No sugar, that's what the fresh fruit is for. I agree with the other reviewer from Madrid, it should be fruity, not too sweet, and strong (Brandy is a must). Enjoy "

I read the reviews and made some changes considering the crowd at the party. I had rum at home so I used that instead of brandy. Since my mother in law likes sweet drinks I didn't cut the sugar completely but used half of what the recipe called for. I used ginger ale instead of soda water and waited until the party to add that so that it wouldn't be flat (You can always add more if you think it's still dry and taste more like wine) I made it a night before and let it sit overnight. I took some of the oranges and lemons out in the morning so it wouldn't be too citrusy. I added apples and strawberries in the morning as well. Make sure to at least double the recipe since it's gonna be the most popular drink at the party! "

I use the carbonated water instead, just before serving. The recommended amount of brandy is good, but taste it to see if it's \"strong\" enough for you and your guests...know your audience though...this stuff can sneak up on you ;-) "

I use blackberry brandy and the cheapest bottles of wine. I also let it sit in the fridge THEN freeze. Why? I have large parties and never know how much of this to make. So I make six batches and freeze. I put a frozen section into my punch bowl and pour Sierra Mist over the top and it gets slushy. (Alcohol doesn't really freeze solid.). I then add fresh oranges and raspberries. (I have also added fruit at stage one and frozen it. That allows the berries to soak up the alcohol; I prefer fresh berry taste vs. laden with brandy.) Making it ahead allows me to focus on other things the week of the party, knowing my Sangria is done. Everyone asks me for this recipe. I claim it as my own. :) "

I've used peach schnapps and\/or triple sec. Brandy is a must. I've added plums, peaches, strawberry, pineapple, etc. I always add some cranberry\/raspberry juice (about a 1\/2 cup) and I use a can of ginger ale that I add right before serving as suggested. And I don't ever add sugar. You really can't go wrong using the basics of this recipe and tweaking it to make it your own. You will want to double the recipe if you are having company. It goes so fast! Thanks for sharing. "

I usually have to at least quadruple the recipe and found that you can get away with using inexpensive, boxed red wine. I had the same experience as another reviewer - that the men who started out with beer and chose to stick with it when offered the sangria changed their minds after they tasted it and abandoned their beers and drank the sangria for the rest of the evening. Definitely make it the night before for best taste. If you have leftovers after your event I suggest removing the fruit. "

I am in Mexico for the winter, so we don't have the limeade concentrate anywhere. Otherwise, I followed the recipe almost exactly. I only put in four tablespoons of sugar and it was better without the sparkling water I added to the top of the glasses on the first round. The first time I made it, I used a Pinot Noir and it was perfect. The second time I made it, I used a Malbec. A little dryer and darker in color. I will stick with the Pinot for this recipe. I did not use cherries, but added a plum, a peach and strawberries to the citrus. I doubled the recipe for 8 people and everyone loved it. I didn't realize there were so many recipes for Sangria. This one was fine and you really can't make a mistake, unless you make it too sweet. "

I added sliced apples, frozen strawberries and frozen blueberries to this the first night. The second night, I pulled all of the citrus and apples out and added a cinnamon stick and two mixed fruit cups to slightly alter the flavor. I used cheap Christian Brothers VS brandy and BOTA box Shiraz (which I love anyway), plus triple sec. It tasted FANTASTIC, but I wasn't feeling more than a little buzzed after several glasses.

I followed the recipe but with a few minor changes: I added an apple, a pear, and a pineapple (with the juice). I used a blackberry brandy and triple sec. I left out the sugar (it's sweet enough without it. If some prefer a sweeter sangria, add a shot of triple sec to the glass before serving). I let it sit in the fridge for over 24 hours and added seven-up just before serving. I did add ice to it, and it didnt seem to water it down at all. When I ran out, I just poured in more wine, brandy and triple sec and it was almost as good as the original batch. If you're looking for a knock-your-socks off Sangria recipe, THIS IS IT. "

A few suggestions...I doubled the recipe to make a nice, large container of sangria! I also, used frozen, sweetened cherries, lots of oranges, limes and lemons. Substitute orange juice for orange concentrate and it's a hit! At the very end, add 1\/2 bottle of sweet champagne to give that extra kick! Soo good! Will make again! "

I use the oranges and also some apples too, depends on what I have on hand. I use a sweeter red wine and no sugar. I am asked to make this for every holiday and get together. I always make a double batch and that usually isn't enough. It goes down like juice but really packs a punch! Thanks for the great recipe! "

I doubled the recipe, (used a Tempranillo for the red wine) added tequila, about a cup, also added fresh pineapple & a firm apple, cut into small pieces, a handful of grapes & a sliced kiwi to the fruit. I substituted a jar of natural bing cherries for the maraschino cherries (no artificial coloring or sugar additives) and used the cherry syrup in place of the sugar in the recipe. Then I used sparkling water rather than the lemon-lime soda. It came out great, everyone raved about it & wanted the recipe, which I posted the original on Facebook. Thanks, HJacoby, for submitting!

I gave it a sample before going to get orange juice and more triple sec. It tasted great! Like all other good sangria's I've had. Got oj and ts, added, tasted again. Not as good. Left if fridge overnight. Again, not as good. The triple sec is just way to strong. Adds that synthetic orange type of flavor triple sec has and is just overbearing. I think using about 1\/3 the recommended sugar is also a good idea. I didn't use carbonated water or ginger ale. Next time I make this I'm going to do it exactly to the recipe, but with only 1\/4 of the oj, 1\/4 the triple sec, and 1\/3rd the sugar. I'm betting that will nail it. I'd advise you to taste as you add though, and add these 3 ingredients last. Dial it in how just how you like it. "

So, because of that, we definitely ended up cutting the sweetness with some seltzer. I'd recommend no sugar and then hopefully you wouldn't need the seltzer. Overall it was good, but people definitely said it was a sweeter kind of Sangria. I used the Roijo that someone recommended. Maybe I'd try a different kind next time. Also, I would cut the rounds in half. The orange rounds were too big for the cups. "

I didn't wait to let it sit overnight to try it and it was still good. I let it sit in the refrigerator for about 2 hours. Although, the leftover Sangria was better the next day after having sat in the fridge overnight. It would be nice to dial back the sugar even more-maybe less of the lemon frozen concentrate and replace with fresh lemon juice. The carbonated water was a nice addition and even helped dilute the sweetness of it. I added about 2 teaspoons of cinnamon, and it made it even more delicious! -Cheers! :-) "

(I passed on using the carbonated water and white sugar) Since we had approximately 65 guests coming I wasn't sure how to gauge it so I made 2 gallons. I prepared it 24 hours ahead of time and stored 1 gallon in a glass beverage container with a spigot, and the other gallon in a reserve pitcher. The next day, I unveiled it and you could get drunk off the fumes, which wasn't a bad thing, but I didn't want my guests hammered after one drink. So, needless to say, I poured half of it out into a reserve pitcher to use for later and what I just poured out of the serving container I filled to the top with ginger ale. Thankfully, it sweetened it up perfectly, yet you could still taste all the flavors of the brandy, the wine and fresh fruit. I would say 90% percent was all gone by the end of the party. So if you want to keep it on the sweeter side fill half of whatever container you use with Sangria and the other half with ginger ale and only add the ginger ale right before serving. CHeers! "

If you ladle the sangria into a glass and then add the ginger ale to the glass, you can customize the strength to your guest's taste and each glass will be as \"fizzy\" as the first. "

I also made it early in the morning so the fruit had plenty of time to soak up the alcohol and flavor the wine. Make sure to get fruit into your glass because it was the best part. I used 1\/4 sparkling water to 3\/4 sangria in each cup. YUM. "

I've made sangria recipes before that were not very successful, but I made this pretty close to what was written (I took the 7-up suggestion from other comments, left out the sugar, used frozen black cherries because that's what I had on hand) and it was beyond amazing. I will be making this again...and as I'm taking it to a party this evening I'm regretting not making a bigger batch because this is going to be a big hit. "

The concept is you start at one house for appetizers and cocktails, proceed to another house for the main meal then finish at another house for dessert. I had the privilege of providing appetizers and cocktails. I wasn't sure what to serve because I have a few neighbors that do not indulge in alcoholic beverages. I also didn't want to spend the evening blending drinks and playing bartender and was concerned about a drink for the men so I decided to try this Sangria. OMG...this was the HIT of the evening!!! Even those who had a preference of not indulging had MORE THAN ONE GLASS! I followed the recipe but used Duplin Black River Red wine (it's a little sweeter) and I used Vernors Ginger Ale instead of carbonated water. I also pre filled the wine glasses with diced strawberries, peaches and maraschino cherries. I agree with everyone the key is to let it sit over night. The neighbors were in no rush to proceed to the next house for dinner and everyone wanted me to write down the recipe. :0) "

I 3X'd all ingredients but the fruit and I was sorry, I ended up adding more the day of the party. it will look like A LOT of fruit but it's much better!! To me Lime was the key, added that extra zing in contrast to the sweetness of the orange juice and lemonade. OH and I did what others suggested and used Ginger ale. "

We mix it in a huge stock pot, cover it with plastic wrap, and keep it in a cooler in the back hall for the family to sip on, over Christmas Eve and Christmas Day. The wine we use is often a Cabernet Sauvignon, or a Shiraz. The Brandy is a must. We have used both a cheaper \"triple sec\" and the patron orange liqueur. Since it is mixed, I recommend the triple sec. We generally leave out the sugar and leave the ginger-ale separate for individual servings. Everyone LOVES it. It certainly helps the holiday spirit as well, wink wink. This will be our third year making it. A family favorite, for sure. "

I used a 1.5L bottle of Barefoot \"sweet red\" wine as the base for this sangria and it worked really well. You don't need an expensive wine to make great sangria, after all. Since I made a double, I used a whole can of thawed lemonade concentrate. For the fruit, I used two cans of (drained) pineapple chunks, a jar of maraschino cherries, 2 oranges, 2 lemons, 2 limes and a quart of fresh strawberries. I omitted the sugar and add a 2 liter of ginger ale prior to serving. Also, I let the fruit sit overnight and pulled out most of the citrus in the morning. I froze the citrus (and a few other fruit pieces) throughout the day and then added the frozen pieces back in prior to serving. You definitely want to make it at least 24 hours in advance to let it sit and soak up all the goodness before serving. I will definitely make this again. Fantastic!! "

I used gingerale instead of club soda. I made several additional batches on the fly (total 9 gallons!) that were just as good. I scrubbed bottles of water, froze them and they worked great to keep the sangria cold without diluting it. Sangria and frozen water bottles were placed in a large beverage server with a spout\/spiget. It was perfect and it looked amazing on the Tiki Bar. "

Then I started playing around, this is the beauty of this recipe: you can swap out things and get a completely different flavor. I now use frozen limeade instead of lemonade, I add the full bottles of liquor instead of half, and a lot of fruit. It's great after it's chilled a bit in the fridge, but it's FANTASTIC after it's \"cured\" for 24 hours... it's hard though :) I usually fill a glass 3\/4 full then top off with either Mountain Dew, Sierra Mist, or a fruity pop for a little fizz.

Add a bunch of sugar to hide awfulness, and serve cold and fast to get the party started! American sangria recipies are much better, and far more refined. This one is a great starter! Everyone should try different add-ons. I hate brandy, so I used spiced rum instead. I've also sloshed a little Cointreau in before. I've added pomegranate juice, pomegranate seeds, blood orange slices, blackberries, cherries and even ginger ale (reduce the sugar if you try that.) Sangria is a great chance to try some unusual fruits to jazz up the look if nothing else; just stay away from overbearing flavors. "

Used apples and oranges as the only fruits, no sugar, ginger ale for bubbles and I used one bottle of Merlot and one bottle of bottled Sangria wine (I doubled the recipe). I just made some for tomorrow night and I'm \"sampling\" it. It's really good but I can tell it's strong! "

An hour before serving I added the wine (I used a cheap Merlot) and since there was no room left in the serving bowl, I left out the ginger ale and let people add it to their cups along with some ice if they wanted. Refrigerate everything the night before, including the wine, and it will stay nice and cold. Will definitely make again! "

I tripled it to fit in my beverage server nicely, and I ran out of triple sec the third go round, so I added more OJ and let it sit overnight. I will say that it tasted great immediately, so I\"m not sure if it sitting overnight is really that crucial to this recipe. I took the fruits out in the morning, and added fresh fruit prior to serving with some ginger ale. Next time I will try Blackberry brandy, as I had some last weekend and it was amazing in the Sangria. ** Be warned: this is very strong if you do not dilute with ginger ale or club soda. The way I made it was wonderful! I will make this again and again. It's the best recipe I\"ve found. "

I chopped the apples in cubes and soaked in the brandy overnight prior to making the sangria. What an added surprise for those who bit into them. I received many many compliments. "

I've made it 3 times in the last 3 weekends for friends and everyone (even white wine drinkers) really enjoyed it!! 1st time I made it pretty much to recipe - the 2nd time I didn't have any orange juice so fresh squeezed some and it was delicious. Never had the cherries - but it was great. And twice I didn't have the time for it to sit more than about 5 hours and it was still delicious. "

I didn't have everything the recipe called for, so I did my best to replace with simliar items. I didn't have regular brandy, so I used cherry brandy. I didn't have triple sec, so I used Grand Mariner. I didn't have maraschino cherries, but I did have some sour cherries from Trader Joe's that I added. I let it sit about 30 hours. YUM! It was a hit!

No sugar used and also chilled all ingredients, added only some of the citrus fruit to sit then removed it and added more fruit just prior to serving.

I let the fruit marinate in the mixture over night but removed all the citrus rinds the next morning. I then added fresh citrus fruit a few hours before serving. The drink received rave reviews. The next day I removed the citrus rinds and added blackberries, strawberries, apples, and a few peaches (just what I had in kitchen) I served it with a few pieces of fruit in the glass, some ice, and a splash of ginger ale. (Subbed Sierra Mist when we ran out of ginger ale) We ended up finishing it off that second night. Not bad for 6 mommies! "

Now, for the adjustments\/additions I made. In reading other reviews, I adjusted as follows: I used an entire frozen lemonade container (tube). I did not add any fruits (no sliced lemon, no sliced lime, etc) until it had been marinating in the fridge for about 12 hours. Then 4 hours before serving, I added diced apple (1 red, 1 green), diced strawberries, diced lemon, diced lime, and blackberries. Instead of carbonated water, as I poured each drink I topped it off with a little Ginger Ale (in some cases I used Fresca, which was my personal favorite) and put a few extra blackberries and diced apples as a garnish. It was light, refreshing, and DELICIOUS!! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this recipe!!! :) "

Next time I won't add the extra lemon juice or lemon slices. I think it might have helped to make it a little too sour. I wasn't sure if I should let this sit out all night without being in the refrigerator but my container was too big to sit in the fridge so I took the advice of another review and stuck it in a ice chest with some ice overnight. Next time I might try apricot brandy because I like my sangria a little more fruity tasting and I don't think blackberry brandy is that much different than regular brandy. I forgot to add the sparkling water. I agree with other post. It doesn't need it. "

But I wanted to try something a little different, and convinced my wine snob husband to do the same. I made this exactly as directed, the only difference being that I didn't see the need to add soda to the drink. I can see that if one is not accustomed, adding a little soda could make it go down easier. I made it a day ahead, and we had it as a weekend cocktail--very tasty! I reminded my husband that I would order something similar at a bar, served in a tall glass with crushed ice, a straw, & garnished with a cherry or to, and happily pay 8 bucks. In fact, I think that's how I'll serve it in the future. Great summertime cocktail! "

I cut back the lemons and limes by half and removed them after a few hours vs overnight (otherwise it gets very sour tasting). I have used limeaid (instead of lemonaid-can use either), always use gingerale (vs sugar and tonic water) and **blackberry brandy** (my favorite ingredient so I add about 1\/2 C more). This is fabulous anytime of yr and great \"on the rocks\". My family & friends beg me to make for ALL gatherings now....so I always double the recipe.

All in all, this is an absolutely delicious recipe, and an oh so beautiful color! Don't forget to eat the fruit out of it the next morning. Mm mm good! Sangria is traditionally a recipe from Spain (yumm...) and, this recipe is pretty accurate. The only real difference between this and a legitimate Spanish sangria is the sweetness, which probably comes from the addition of the lemonade concentrate (and also the sugar, which I've already mentioned, but nobody said it was illegal to like your booze sweetened!)

I also continued to have it for the next two days (I made a bit too much), and it still tasted good. I love this recipe. I don't use brandy because I don't like the taste of brandy. Sometimes I throw in the ingredients without measuring, and it tastes good regardless because all of the ingredients work well. I usually leave the cherries out too. I just thought it was a lot of fruit and they weren't necessary for me. Instead of carbonated water, I add ginger ale sometimes. Be sure to add it at the last minute though if you want bubbles. "

I put in only 1\/6 of a cup of lemonade concentrate and eliminated he maraschino cherries as well as the sugar. I found the fruit slices overwhelmed my pitcher, but I like them in the glasses. I fished the majority of the fruit of the pitcher before serving. I then sliced fresh lemon and orange slices and placed them in each glass and placed one on the rim of each glass as a beautiful garnish. Sadly, they made it very difficult to drink and all fruit ended up in the glass. With these changes I was asked to make this cocktail for every family function. Only after a double batch can put up with my in-laws. : ) "

I made this almost exactly true to the recipe the first time, and then made a few changes the next time to suit our tastes. I used limeade instead of lemonade as we found it a bit too lemony the first time. I added club soda instead of carbonated water right before serving and did not add sugar or cherries as it was plenty sweet enough. Another change I made was to add frozen grapes before serving to keep it cool and added 2 more oranges for more fruit to munch on. This is so good and refreshing on a hot summer day you will want to keeping drinking it but it hits you harder than you realize.

A single batch would be good for a group of 4 anymore and you want to double or triple it. I tripled it for a party of 15 and it was gone in about 2 hours. So if your party-goers enjoy sangria make a lot. The key is letting it sit over night in the fridge. Also one other tip to save on wine is Traders Joes \u2013 2 Buck Chuck works great- I have used the Merlot, Zinfandel, Cabernet Sauvignon and the Shriaz and got great result. (I do not recommend Chianti that other Sangria recipies call for, I think it always comes out too sweet.) I never have any leftovers of this when I have a party. I never use the sugar I think it would be too sweet and I always have two litters of club soda for people to add to it if they like, but I don\u2019t mix it in the bowl. Also if you can take some of the lemon aid, maybe a little bit of water, some OJ and fruit and make an ice ring the night before to float in it so you don\u2019t have to dilute it was ice. "

Im not a cherry person so did not include cherries. I used fresh squeezed orange and lemon juices when it called for that. i also used clementines instead of oranges, the flavor is so much better I think. I only used 3 rounded tbsp sugar as Im not a sweet drink person. I added 2 fresh nectarines and 2 cups fresh pineapple. I used sprite instead of club soda or gingerale as I had omitted some of the sugar. This was truly an excellent Sangria and several people insisted on the recipe before they left. It was a serious hit. You wont be dissappointed. "

Here is what I bought to make enough to make 5 times the recipe (30 servings). 4L jug of Carlo Rossi Sangria wine, 750 ml bottel of Blackberry Brandy, 750 ml bottel of triple sec, and a couple of 2 liter bottles ginger ale. I used all the wine and most of the brandy and triple sec. I added the ginger ale before serving and only used about a 1\/2 a bottle (wanted to add more so that it would serve more people but the taste testers said it was great and not to add any more). I did not use sugar and made it the night before. I should have made the serving for 60 or even more because it went fast. Will absolutly make again, and I dont even like wine!! "

I cut back just a tad on the rum and triple sec, and used the ginger ale in place of the carbonated water. HUGE improvement. I would say this is now a 4 star recipe.

I have adapted the fruits some and use nectarines, apples, and oranges in the mix and add a slice of lemon to the edge of the glass so that the citrus rides with every sip. I have used this recipe to make sangria for a lot of summer parties and everyone just loves it. Allowing to sit overnight\/over 12 hours is definitely key. I have adapted the recipe slightly, and this is what I've found really brings out all the flavors. I mix the fruit with the brandy, sugar, and triple sec 2 days beforehand. Then the next day I add the orange juice, lemon juice, lemonade concentrate, and red wine. Then I mix the carbonated water individually for each drink the next day. Makes for a wonderfully refreshing summer drink! "

W\/out the sugar and triple sec, its the perfect amount of semi-sweetness...not too much as to not be refreshing but just enough to make it a treat. I took the suggestion of adding the soda as i was serving it for a little bit of fizz.

I just happen to keep Cointreau in stock. For the brandy I use Wild Cherry brandy. I omit the sugar completely. I mix it all up, then let it sit for about 18 - 24 hours. Then I take a glass, fill it with ice cubes, fill about 1\/3 to 1\/2 of the glass with Club Soda, then top it with the Sangria. Oh My Goodness...it is the best! I would have never thought that using club soda would be my preference, but it most definitely IS. I made a triple batch for the Fourth of July (only 4 of us total) and I had to make another triple batch the morning of the second day, or we would have run out. Try this recipe exactly as it is written, and then you can easily make any adjustments you prefer. However be forewarned, you need to plan ahead a wee bit, because if you let it sit over night, or even 4-6 hours, it is much much better. Everything seeps and melds together and mixes just wonderfully.I think that is the secret to this particular Sangria recipe. "

I did subsititure Grenadine for the sugar - adds the sweetness and enhances the color. Definitely add the club soda right before serving - gives it a sizzle! "

I used a low cost merlot and cherry brandy, skipped the sugar and offered seltzer on the side for anyone who wanted to add it. I quadrupled the recipe so I would have enough to last the entire gathering...which I didn't! Many asked for the recipe before departing the event. I have made it since using apricot brandy, which was also wonderful. I will caution you that if you have left-overs, remove the fruit. If it sits more than a day, the skin's give it a bitter aftertaste. An excellent summer-time offering! Thanks for the recipe! "

I also used an inexpensive Shiraz for the wine and let the mixture sit in the fridge for about 36 hrs. (After doing some online research regarding which type of wine to use, I found out that Sangria was originally made with inexpensive table wines to enhance their flavor, which makes complete sense and did the job! I can't see using an expensive wine just to doctor it up?!) I added Ginger Ale right before serving. Myself and my guests highly recommend this recipe! "

You really can't go wrong with the fruit combos.

I also left all the fruit in the pitcher and instead of floating slices I put a pineapple spear in with each 8 oz. glass (juice glass). It was a hit. "

It can serve about 5-6 servings. If you have a big crowd or you think that your guests will want more than one glass, double or triple this recipe!

I add a little extra lemon juice and half the triple sec and make a simple syrup with the sugar, as it mixes together much better. I also marinate the fruit int he punch 12-18 hours, then \"muddle\" to get the extra pulp and juice - discarding the rinds before they add bitterness to the sangria. I buy the Taylor Lake County red in the BIG bottle (less than $12 at Walmart) - and it is great. Be sure to drink on a full stomache, as this has quite a kick! "

Have made it successfully many many times. 1) I recommend using orange curacao - I settle on this after experimenting with triple sec and others but invariably this provides the smoothest, richest flavor. 2) A raw cane sugar * lemon juice combo can easily be substituted for the lemonade concentrate (which is afterall just a shortcut). 3) I find a merlot is the best choice for a deeper flavor. 4) Make sure it is well chilled and all the fruit nice and alcoholic!

I didn't want to purchase any additional liquor for the recipe, so I went with what I happened to have on hand (mango rum and Grand Marnier instead of the brandy and triple sec - though Grand Marnier is actually a variety of triple sec liquour that is made with cognac brandy). I did not add the sugar, and used 7up instead of soda water (again, I was trying to work with what I had on had). I tasted it when I first put it together and I questioned the recipe, but after having a day to mellow out it was outstanding. I made a double batch and everyone went back for seconds (at least). This will be my go to recipe for sangria from now on. "

Cut sugar down to 1 cup; added pineapple and a can of peaches. Stored in frig overnight and bought 2 bottles of 7Up, which people could chose to add (and most did).

        "Review":"One of my all-time favorite drink recipes -- have made for various occasions now and everyone has always been pleased. Never had sangria before this, but I'm sure nothing else will compare. I've tried this by the recipe, and also using the peach schnapps \/ rum swap - both are delicious, though I don't prefer triple sec quite as much. The first couple times I made it with Red Cat, bc that's the only type of red wine I know I like... however, after reading many reviews, I tried the cheaper red wine and it tastes just as delicious !!! No need to use the more expensive wine -- I'd save that for drinking it by itself. This sangria is fantastic.. thanks for the awesome recipe. PS -- guests love eating the cherries after they've been soaked for a day ! "

Mmmm...I omitted the sugar and served with ginger ale and seltzer water optional. It was a hit! Not a drop left. I also sliced half of the oranges in rounds but put in the rest in edible chunks and they were delicious. I was a little short on brandy (used a 750 mL bottle, which was a little less than a cup short of what was called for) and I doubt that it made too much of a difference. Would definitely make again!

I say this for two reasons; one, everyone at the brunch I was at commented on how great it tasted (I eased dropped of course); two, everyone was hammered but giddy! The only thing that I really did somewhat different...add strawberries with the other fruit. Also, most important of all is be sure to let the fruit marinate overnight (8hrs) and don't add any soda to it, yet). I waited until I arrived at the brunch and then added 7-up to it. This way, it had a little bubble flavor to it and the soda wasn\u2019t flat sitting in the fridge overnight! The apricot brandy was good additive! 7 gallons of this stuff makes for some really good stories out of people you\u2019ve never met! "

I took the advice of another reviewer and used peach schnapps instead of triple sec. I didn't use any cherries, but instead added blueberries, kiwis, and pineapples. However, the pineapples were a bit iffy. I guess they have some kind of special digestive enzyme in them and so they will do weird things to the sangria if you use a lot or if you add the juice as well. I did both of these things once but it still tasted fine, just smelled a little ripe. I made sure it was consumed the very next day. Also, I think the cabonated water or 7-up really ruins this drink. Try it without or let people choose if they want to add it or not. "

As other reviewers suggested, I used Sprite (instead of sugar and carbonated water) to sweeten. I also used some of the maraschino cherry juice to sweeten it, as well. I didn't have oranges, but I cut up some strawberries to add. You can easily drink a lot of this because it does not have a strong alcohol taste. Be careful not to drink too much; the next day is a bit rough. :) "

I used peach schnapps instead of triple sec, and instead of the traditional citrus, which makes it bitter if you leave it in too long, I drained a can of Dole tropical fruit, pureed it, then added it to the sangria, I also added about half of the juice. I sweetened with about 2 T sugar, and 1\/4 c maraschino cherry juice, since the cherries just sink to the bottom anyway. I added the club soda to the glasses as we drank it...AWESOME!! "

Soaked fruit overnight in the rum and sugar and added the wine and OJ a couple of hours prior to serving. Definitely a keeper.

I followed the suggestions of eliminating the sugar and using Ginger Ale as a carbonator, added gingerale to the glass at the end, didn't work. Added the 1\/4 c. of sugar and it didn't help much so when the brige group arrived, I dumped the 2 cups of Ginger Ale in the pitcher with the mix. There were no 2nds asked. Didn't expect any to be leftover but it is 'marinating' in the refrigerator and I will probably throw it out. Oh, I did use a good wine that I would drink. Too sour, even with sugar, and too lemony and fruit didn't look pretty, like Helen's. "

        "Review":"A very forgiving recipe! We made this last night for a party, and everyone enjoyed it. (We made it last for an Easter gathering, with boisterous reviews.) Last night, one person switched from white wine to the Sangria and never went back! We made three changes because we think we are \"Sangria Aficianados.\" We omitted the cherries and carbonated water, and added 1\/2 cup Peach Schnapps, and substituted diet 7-Up for the water. Aside from the basic bones of this recipe (the wine, oranges, lemons, limes and specified liqours), many variation work. Apples and Pears work. We always add Brandy and Triple Sec and use 7-Up, but if something is not around or we run out, we find substitutes. I have friends who add dry fruit to their Sangria. (I think it is sweeter, but tasty. They used dried mango and pineapple.) This is really a great ice breaker at a party of friends or acquaintances. "

I also had to improvise because I realized I didn't have the brandy OR the triple sec I though I had. SO, instead I used burbon and orange flavored tequila that I had on hand. Instead of the sugar I used sweet & low and added extra as I like my sangria just a little bit sweeter. I marinated overnight (including the cherries) and it was the single best sangria I'd ever had. I did NOT add the carbonated soda as it was perfect without. I took the rest over to my dad, the sangria affectionado and he also proclaimed it the best ever....and we fought over the 'marinated' cherries. If I can make it with tequila and burbon and still have it be phenomenal, how would it be if I followed with brandy and triple sec???? I need to find out! I removed the fruit on my second batch--after leaving the citrus slices in for 48 hours my first batch started turning bitter. This is definitely the new party drink at our house! "

I made a double batch and used 2 oranges, 2 limes and 2 lemons per the recipe. Next time, I'll use one of each for a double batch just to save space in the pitcher and glasses.

The flavors from the sliced fruits really come out after the Sangria sits overnight. I doubled the recipe and it nearly made two quarts. I am not a maraschino cherry fan so I left those out. If you would like, you could add a little club soda to your glass to tone it down for those who cannot handle the stronger flavors of the alcohol.

        "Review":"Not a bad recipe at all. Ensure you are using the \"good stuff\" as others have mentioned. Makes a world of difference. I typically use a sugar cube and some water with bitters. Also make sure you get large ice cubes for this drink. They dont melt as fast and water it down. I would never use a full orange slice. This isnt a screwdriver. Instead a hint of orange goes a long way with a simple twist of the orange peel over the glass then put the twist in the drink. Also luxardo cherries are a MUCH better choice for this drink. A little pricey but well worth it. As an added bonus if you want this drink smoked, use wood chips on a safe surface, light them on fire with a blowtorch, then place your glass over the wood chips to catch the smoke. While the glass fills with smoke, make your old fashioned and transfer it in to the smoked glass. "

I combine several dashes of bitters, a fresh cherry (cut in half, remove bit, then squeeze some juice into glass and add remaining cherry). A slice of orange (a small amount if the juice is squeezed in, then twist the rind to get the oils and essence). Several ounces of bourbon (or rye, etc, but I love Makers) sugar\/simple syrup (I prefer sugar in the raw or a cube, it will bring good flavor) add a splash of water and stir. You get good bourbon flavor, with just a touch of the sweet and the juice to cut it. If you are making something like an old fashioned you need to taste the bourbon, if you don't want to taste it go get a vodka red bull, or a wine cooler. "

I bought some Jameson whiskey for a dinner recipe and had some leftover and decided to try a classic cocktail. This tasted like straight whiskey on ice. I tried to modify it by doubling and then tripeling the simple syrup, doubling the oranges and squeazing them, and then adding in a couple of splashes of the cherry juice from the jar as others suggested. It made it more palateable then, but it still tasted too strong to drink. I wish I wouldn't have spent the extra money now on the bottle of bitters now. It couldn't be tasted anyway. I don't know what to think? Maybe, I just don't like whiskey? Hmmm "

I've found most pre made sour mixes are not made well and while margarita mix is arguably similar if not the same thing it does seem to make a difference. For the raspberry-flavored liqueur you really should use Chambord specifically. It's expensive but maybe start with the nips if you can find them but it makes a world of difference. Cheaper alternatives like razmataz do not have the specific flavor profile needed. Also, this could be me but it needs to be ice cold! if it gets warm in any way blegh. Pretty much this is a raspberry long island iced tea, easy to make and a punch in the face for sure.\nOther than that if you don't like it then all good. We all have different tastes and can change any cocktail we want to fit it. This is the traditional recipe tho, play around a bit. "

The Margarita substituted tequila, with lime and salt being the traditional accompaniments. Then the mongrelization began. When I came upon the Margarita in the 70\u2019s, it had been reduced to cheap tequila, bar mix and a pound of ice to be processed in a blender: an adult Slurpee. Follow the above recipe as if your life depended on it. Use a quality tequila, Cointreau and fresh squeezed lime juice. Triple Sec has always been used by bars as a cheap substitute for Cointreau, but they don\u2019t taste the same. As far as turnbot\u2019s use of an eggwhite, you are on your own. A Margarita is a cocktail, not the breakfast of champions. "

        "Review":"This recipe is not bad: my \"perfect margarita\" calls for only half an ounce of triple sec (as opposed to 1 once; that much will override the great tequila flavour). Speaking of tequila: your margarita will be as good as the tequila you buy! Avoid the \"well-brand\" tequilas: for an affordable yet tasty tequila, get Cazadores or El Jimedor reposado. I'm not a fan of \"straight up\" style margaritas, so I'll always have mine with lots of rocks (ice), or blended. If you want a really frothy, truly PERFECT margarita... Before shaking, throw in half an egg white into your shaker! You'll never go back - trust me! "

That banana threw the whole thing off for me...However I tried it again today following the ingredients as listed and it tastes great! Much better! "

I think that if you use pineapple juice & OJ it might have a stronger fruity taste than the dole juice. I will definetly be making this all summer long. thanks! "

I used cups instead of ouces and made a batch to put in the frig. Even good the next day. Definately a keeper, just will use the recommended amount of booze for a gathering....could scare people!

I always have a signature cocktail for Memorial Day and this is the best so far. "

I do want to try it again, this time adding the Amaretto & fresh lime as suggested by others. I do think that there's definitely enough coconut rum & would not add more.

I do think it is a MUST to add amaretto in this as well to get the almond flavor that Mai Tai's have. Also half of a freshly squeezed lime is great in it as well! I like to add the lime and amaretto in it to make a more authentic tasting Mai Tai, but this recipe is for sure still great as written. Thanks for the recipe! This will be added to the list of favorites. "

So for a Friday easy dinner at their place I made this with tequila rather than brandy, all the citrus and apple. Then threw in strawberries, because I had 3 packs in the fridge. It only got an hour in the fridge so hadn't really developed fully. But sure went down well, the dogs loved the apple pieces, and even ate the orange peel. I need to make again. "

I misread the recipe and thought it called for only 1\/2 cup of rum \u2026 I actually used 3\/4 cup and that was plenty, especially since I now see a lot of reviewers are complaining that the rum is overpowering. Also, in my opinion this doesn't need any sugar at all. So 4 stars because of too much rum and sugar, but after cutting back on those ingredients I would give it 5 stars. Also, I made ice cubes with fruit-flavored sparkling water to keep the mixture cold without diluting the flavor too much. "

I used Marques de Caceras Cranzia tempranillo with overproofed Wray and Nephew rum as the alcoholic bases, and they interacted quite well with each other. The thing is, it didn't even taste very alcoholic. It really snuck up on all of us. However, if you're going to go the tempranillo route, I do not recommend going the riserva or gran riserva route, or with any well-oaked wine for that matter. You're going to want a dry but fruity red. Oak is not going to add to this recipe, because it focuses heavily on fruit flavors. "

Used ~ 3\/4 cup spiced rum, and ~1\/4 cup Triple Sec. Since I had them, we used frozen cotton candy grapes for ice cubes. ~~~ We enjoyed this very much! We don't drink often, but when we're in the mood, I'm sure we'll have this again! "

I also made the sangria all at once & put it in the fridge for a few hours. I was a perfect amount of alcohol. I recommend adding ice to your glass. It was a refreshing drink on a hot Florida day.

I typically substitute a double bottle of wine which yields more and the taste isn't compromised. Also, it tastes better if you let the fruit soak the rum overnight. Definitely make a double batch because it will be gone by the end of the night! That said, warn your guests that it packs a punch. I've had a few people stand up at the end of the night unaware of the affect. Great for patio parties - happy summer! "

I read reviews and used the recommended spiced rum and a big cheap bottle of blackberry merlot. I only had 3\/4 cup of rum left, so I added a little cointreau to make a full cup of liquor. My fruit (lemon, lime, apple, strawberries, pineapple) soaked in the rum\/cointreau\/sugar\/orange juice all day, and I added the merlot before bed last night. I also poured in some ginger ale before serving for fizz. Everyone loved it. My aunt said it was the best sangria she's ever had. Thanks for the recipe! Will use this again for parties for sure. "

I used two oranges sliced in rounds, a lemon, a lime, three different types of apples, about 25 strawberries sliced, and a pair (I needed to make a huge batch). I put all of the fruit in a container, put about three quarters of a cup of sugar over the fruit, and then added 2 cups of very high-quality spiced rum. I let that soak in the fridge overnight, and then in the morning, I poured about a cup and a half of orange juice and three bottles of wine over the fruit and rum mixture. I let that sit in the fridge for another couple of hours before the party. I served it with ice on the side, and everyone loved it. Couldn't get enough of it!! Because of the high quality rum, no one has a headache today either. :-) "

I use brandy & a splash of triple sec or OJ, maybe a splash of peach schnapps, allow it to blend\/chill for several hours or overnight. I've also used blackberry brandy as well as ginger brandy for kicks - comes out great. I prefer to serve it with club soda - or ginger ale for those who prefer it sweeter. Again, sorry, but I'd skip this recipe and Google Sangria...you'll find brandy is much more authentic than rum. But hey, whatever works for ya! Also, add any citrus LAST ~ all fresh citrus turns bitter after a couple hours. Cheers! "

To me, sangria is a year round drink, but most like it as a summer beverage. I love it with rum, like this recipe calls for, but a neutral spirit like vodka works just as well. I'm from Texas, where we like things either really sweet, or really spicy, so I double the sugar. Aside from that, if you're in a hurry, you can really just throw all the ingredients together at once and serve it over ice (which you should do anyway). If you're having a party, go ahead and do yourself a favor and make double the amount. Some people like a splash of 7up to top off their glass. "

I also used more fruit including strawberries, peaches, oranges, maraschino cherries,apple, pear, lemon and extra lime. Also, it's tastes soooooo good with all that fruit, the sugar is just completely unnecessary, so I didn't use any at all. And I soaked the fruit in rum overnight as suggested by others. (And yes, the fruit tastes amazing after soaking, so don't let too many people taste-test it before adding to the sangria!) I also used orange juice ice cubes in the glasses as suggested by someone else. My guests raved about it and it was all gone in no time! As per the recommendation of the staff member at the liquor store I used Jackson Triggs Merlot red wine and it was delicious. I will definitely be making this again! "

Of course I modified it based on what I had on hand -- I added some sprite and club soda (almost an entire 2 litre bottle's worth) to make a larger amount -- the sugar is necessary at that point. Also added some apricot brandy (about 1\/2 cup). I had some leftover limeade made up as well so I added that (about 2 cups -- note: this was NOT substitued for the OJ -- that was added as well.) Guests raved about it and said they wanted the recipe. It did look pretty with the citrus fruit slices in a large glass pitcher. "

My main qualm is that what makes the sangria taste good--the citrus fruit--is annoying once you go to drink it. Do you strain the slices? Do you eat them? Eating them makes a mess. Next time, I think I'll make this sangria the same way, but before serving it to guests I'll strain out the citrus slices and throw in only edible fruits, like pineapple, apple, or cherries. I don't know how that will affect the taste, but the experience might improve? "

I will also add a little less sugar next time (I think a quarter cup would be fine), but wow, this is fabulous!!

Everyone, yes everyone LOVES this recipes. I save it and use it for all the spring, summer, fall parties I have! Good for drinking by the pool also! Now: January 2016: I make this for EVERY party I have: at least 3 times a year. This time I edited this way: and I must say: even more raves! I quadruple it: which is easy with allrecipes.com calculator on each recipe! Instead of orange juice use FRESH grapefruit juice (in the produce section). Instead of oranges: use red grapefruit slices. I use SPICED rum. Decrease the sugar by a 1\/4. Two big pinches of salt (brings out the citrus flavor). For only 6 servings I would use a small pinch of salt. I always use a Cabernet wine. Okay to add an extra bottle of wine to stretch punch. Just keep tasting, as you add, before you add the slices of fruit. Keep muddling the fruit...the more the fruit is bruised in the punch: I think the better it tastes. I would say the punch today is the best yet. And I have made it at least 18 times! "

        "Review":"This is my go to basic sangria recipe. I took another reviewers advice and used Blackberry Merlot instead of dry red wine. This also eliminates the need for the 1\/2 cup of sugar since the Blackberry Merlot is a sweetened wine. I like using spiced rum such as Captain Morgans. I soak the fruit (I usually add strawberries) in the rum several hours before putting the other ingredients. A bonus is getting to eat the rum\/wine soaked fruit afterwards :) Very yummy, there are never any leftovers!! "

I mixed up the rum, fruit, and sugar the night before and added the wine a couple of hours before serving. The only issue I had was in trying to get the sugar dissolve. Awesome recipe, though.

I lower the octane a bit by reducing the total the rum amount to just over 2 cups, and the OJ to about 1.5 cups. Otherwise, the (junk) wine flavor gets lost. I like it better when it's all balanced.

I love making it in the summer to have around for those lovely, lazy afternoons... I add a little more rum, triple sec, a bunch of fruit and mix everything together in one pitcher, letting it all chill in the fridge. Adding a couple of pieces of fresh fruit to each glass is pretty but not necessary. And I never dilute it. Ever. If you are making this in advance (which I recommend), after a day the fruit takes on that red color. So, if you are going for pretty, changing out the fruit before presentation is a good idea. "

I doubled the recipe so hence needed 3 cups of rum - I used 1.5 cups of Bajan Mount Gay and 1 cup of Dark Rum - the remaining half cup was made up with Peach Schnapps (some other Sangria recipes call for Peaches). I used Merlot and omitted the sugar - perhaps the Schnapps made the mixture more sweet as I didn't feel I needed the sugar. I added lots of thin slices of the fruit and chopped additional smaller pieces for use in the glass. I didn't have time to let the Sangria sit for two hours so served it within 30 minutes. It was a huge hit and marinating the flavors together overnight must make this a complete winner. Thank you Lisa. "

I realized I only had 1\/2 cup of orange juice on hand rather than the full cup so I used about 1\/2 cup of triple sec to supplement the OJ. I also added about 1\/2 cup of sour mix. "

She said this is like the versions some of the newer restaurants have started serving the past few years. She said the traditional sangria is made with port(no rum) and lots of sliced citrus fruit and juice except for one small region where the locals use madeira and a splash of rum and lots of citrus. She also said your version is commonly found more towards France. "

The important step seems to be the 2-hour marinating time in which the fruit and the rum get \"happy\". I used a white merlot for the wine, and it was well balanced. (I don't care for really dry, woody wines.) Alcohol content is really personal preference, and for me, this recipe had twice as much rum as I'd like, so I will cut the rum in half next time. All the party goers enjoyed thje sangria as well, but most chose to cut it with Sprite or OJ. I will definitely make it again with less rum. Thanks for sharing this :-) "

I used 2 c. of rum, 1c of brandy, 1c. sugar, 1 c orange juice... i let all that mix for an hour or so then dumped in 1 liter & a half bottles of the cheapest merlot at wal-mart. will fill with ice to cut it down a bit (willbe sitting out allnight) and have club soda and ginger-ale for those who need to cut it down a bit but just taste tested it and WOW!!!!! that it a big ol' jug of trouble it is fabulous and i expect it to go quickly...since i made 2 containers showing up with 5 gallons of sangria may just make me the hit of the party!!

I used 2007 Turning Leaf Merlot for the wine, and Tortuga Bay spiced rum. The taste was very smooth and fruity. It was delicious, and it kicked us all in the butt, so be careful how much you drink. It will creep up on you! Thanks for the great recipe and tips from the other reviewers. "

I used a cheap shiraz and a combo of fresh orange and grapefruit juice becuase thats all I had on hand. I also used some pinapple juice left over from another punch I made that night. Not a big deal.

The sangria was a little stronger than I wanted, so I added 1\/2 cup of apple juice and 1\/2 more orange juice. I was a little short on the rum, so I made up the difference with pomegranite liquor.

I have made it with letting it sit 4 hours or overnight and recommend the 4 hours. When I made it the night before it still tasted good but was slightly bitter from all the citrus rinds. I have also made it with a $3 bottle of Merlot or a much more expensive wine and there is no difference in the flavor so save your money.

I used only one cup of the rum and half the sugar, and would recommend that you adjust the sweetness and liquor according to your own taste - if you like a stiffer or a sweeter drink. You can also add any kind of fruit that you like, so it's a very forgiving recipe. For the wine I used a bottle of Concha y Toro merlot\/cab sauv blend. 1.5 liters for $7, but you'd never know it was cheap wine with this recipe! "

I also added the rum with the sugar and fruit the night before the party and let it sit All day to let the flavors develop. Yum!! I had to warn my guests about the rum because they didn't believe there was very much in this recipe. Boy were they wrong!! "

Used 1\/2c of simple syrup instead of the granulated sugar and used a green apple, pear, peach, & lemon. Will have to up the Cap Morgan to the recommended 1.5c since I found it not that strong. Will be making double batches for my 4th of July party. "

        "Review":"Fabulous! My first sangria made and it was an absolute HIT with a very large party. I did read all the reviews and made slight modifications. I went crazy with the fruit selection and skipped on the lemons. I added a lime, an orange, 2 kiwi's, cherries (sliced and pitted - fresh), raspberries (fresh), fresh apricots (sliced), 1 apple (sliced), 1 peach (sliced), and 2 pears (the red kind). I chose for my wine Sutter Home White Merlot. I was very nervous about the wine choice but White Merlot is not sweet like Arbor Mist yet not as \"dry\" as a red table wine\/merlot\/cab\/pinot noir. I still added the sugar and the Orange Juice. Note: I went with a few reviews and used the Bacardi Razz Rum (raspberry rum) and used the full 1.5-2 cups. However, I used that amount with 2 1.5 L bottles of wine so I would agree that if I was making this recipe as originally stated I would use no more than 1 cup of rum. HUGE hit. Brought it to a friend's family party where people were being conservative in drinking alcohol and it was gone within 2 hours flat. The best part (and no-waste part)...we took the remains home (the fruit) and food processed it into a HUGE batch of smoothie for tomorrow night. VERY potent and super yummy. Stay Green! "

Wife kept asking for more, but I had to cut her off for fear she would overdo it. I cut the rum back to 1\/2 cup and it was still potent. I used dark rum as that is what I had in the cabinet. The great thing about sangria is you can use the cheapest dry red wine you can find and, once mixed, it tastes like a million bucks. "

The only thing I did differently was add a cup of Sprite and used fruit that was in season like strawberries, honeydew, pineapple, and tangerines. I also made one pitcher with a $3 bottle of Charles Shaw Shiraz and another pitcher with a $4 bottle of German red. Both were fabulous. You really have to be careful with this stuff because it tastes delicious and you don't realize how much it affects you until it's too late. "

I used fresh cherries and apples instead of lemons. Wouldn't use apples next time. I thought the fruit was too strong and I made about 8 hours prior. In case you are trying to make mass quantities like I was I used a double batch (12 servings) for each punch bowl and it fit perfectly. I made 3 punch bowls (6 batches) for about 17 women. What a hit! They were all talking about me making this \"next time\". lol The orange juice ice cubes were loved. I made Cranberry Sierra Mist (it's new) ice cubes too for a festive look.

I used a bottle of Black Opal cab\/merlot blend, tropicana orange juice, 1 1\/4 cup spiced captain morgans rum, and added a small bottle of blackberry seltzer. I added lots of different fruit (orange, lemon, nectarine, fresh cherries (pit removed), and a drained can of fruit coctail!) Perfect for a summer afternoon party!! "

Some restaurants add brandy, rum, and even vodka. My personal favorite is dark rum, but I scaled back the recipe so that there was only 1 oz. of rum per serving. A slightly less potent concoction, but it still packs a punch! I only gave the recipe four stars because I think that it needs a lot of tweaking for individual preferences and I did not care for the flavor that the lemons and limes added. Next time, I will use oranges and peaches, which is the \"classic\" Spanish fruit of choice in my experience. "

I followed the suggestions of others and cut the rum to 1 cup and went out to get the Blackberry Merlot---I had never heard of it before but found it with the wine drinks....think inexpensive screw tops. The amount of rum was perfect but next time I will use a bottle of merlot wine. This wine product is inexpensive but I'm sorry, I didn't care for it at all. I added a little more OJ and 1\/2 bottle of merlot I had opened the night before to make it drinkable for us. I'm a merlot fan and next time I will use the wine that I normally buy. "

I use a fruit punch juice (whatever's on sale), strawberries, limes, bacardi limon with the wine and triple sec. I have also used a chardonay for a little variety. It has to chill all mixed together for at least 2-3 hours. If for some reason you have extra, pull out the lime slices and it usually keeps pretty well overnight. "

I also put in 1 each kiwi, mango, nectarine, all sliced, along with the orange and lime. My grocery store also carries fresh, already cored pineapple, so I also used that. Eating the fruit after the sangria was gone was a real treat! "

I also added 2-3 sliced strawberries. I used Bacardi Limon, because that's what I had in the cabinet. (and a cheap Merlot) I think I used slightly less rum than the recipe called for; I didn't really measure it. For those who don't like to taste alcohol in their drinks, this will be too strong, but should be good if you cut it with some lemon-lime soda or ginger ale. (and if I make this for guests I will have some available for them, but I love this as is) I will definitely be making this again. "

I've made this recipe many times, and have had friends rave about it (and ask for the recipe!) However, I tend to throw in different types of fruit, whatever I have on hand (I find that strawberries, blueberries, and nectarines are fruits that work well!) and use only 3\/4 cup to 1 cup of rum. I think the sugar is important to help draw out the flavor of the fruit, as well as crushing the fruit after it has chilled in the fridge. Also, I have found that a cheap blackberry merlot (as earlier posters suggested) works best, in my case, a $4 Arbor mist version! I'm the type of person that does not like to taste the alcohol so with these changes, the resulting sangria is sweet, fruity, and will be gone in minutes! "

The sugar is what gives you that terrible headache the next morning. You won't miss it in the flavor. If you want to make this without the 2 hour chill time just fill pitcher with ice, add fruit, then brandy & tripple sec, then wine, then oj splash the schnapps stir with a wooden spoon and you're all done.

I mixed up the first batch the night before the event and fortunately(?) I have to get up early otherwise I might have a couple more glasses. OH, I made this with 2 buck Chuck Merlot from Trader Joes to keep the cost down and not waste a \"good\" wine &Bacardi White (clear) rum -the recommended amount because this recipe doesn't need any added flavor, but any inexpensive white rum will probably do the trick. I added some fresh pink grapefruit to the mix and tomorrow for the party i'll be adding sliced nectarines and strawberries.

For fruit, I used 2 limes, 2 oranges, 1 lemon, strawberries, and canned peaches (and about 1\/2 the juice from the can). I used Arbour Mist blackberrry merlot for the wine, and only added about 3 cups of orange juice to the whole thing. Turned out -excellently-, and was just about perfect for strength.

I sometimes add half rum and half apricot brandy. I ALWAYS add peaches, strawberries, Kiwi, and sometime grapes to the citrus. Everyone loves scooping those up and eating them after they get to the bottom of the sangria. Don't skip on soaking the fruit in the rum and sugar for 2 hrs, and stir it up a couple of times during that 2 hrs. "

I must admit, however, that I doubled the amount of alcohol to two cups and did not find it overpowering. Some may think there is too much sugar, in which case they can just use a little less than recommended. However, considering it makes an entire pitcher, one 1\/2 cup is not an overwhelming amount of sugar. Additionally, the steps could be a little revamped; I find the mint flavour (Canadian here) is absorbed better when it is ground up with the juice of the limes in addition to the sugar. "

I followed the recipe but didn't use as much lime or mint as directed, although I did quarter 2 limes and halved and juiced 1 more and dropped it in the mix - used maybe 20-25 leaves. I recommend not muddling the mint in the sugar too hard because it shreds the mint into tiny bits that get stuck all over your mouth. I also used some rum in my sugar and mint to rinse out the bowl and then pour into the pitcher. Happy drinking all!! "

I made another recipe the first year (I had a by the glass recipe), and between making mojitos and the Cuban sandwiches, I spent all my time in the kitchen. I found this recipe last year, and I simplified my life. I doubled the recipe so to fit our 2 liter pitcher, and muddled the mint and sugar ahead of time, enough for four pitchers. I really do prefer the actual sugar as opposed to the simple syrup recipes, and this one is just perfect. Take my advice and make them ahead if you are serving a crowd. You won't regret it. "

On this occasion we merely substituted celery salt for the sea salt and threw in a couple of spears of pickled asparagus. "

Use this one! However, if you are in your early 20's and it's more of a challenge just to see how much of the cheapest liquor available you CAN possibly drink and still get up the next day, , then you will definitely want to adjust up the measures of Coffee Liqueur and Cream. I was 20 once. I remember. I'm 45 now and I drink premium liquor at a much slower pace! "

I used the 1\/2 cup (4 ounces) of Crabbie's Orginal Alcoholic Ginger Beer and all the other ingredients but added one more: 1 tsp of 'simple syrup' which I made by using a 1:1 ratio of water and sugar (1\/4 cup water to 1\/4 cup sugar or any equal amounts you choose) then microwaving in a glass bowl (NOT in the copper mugs!) and stirring it to dissolve the sugar. The left over simple syrup should be sealed tightly and refrigerated to be used for other recipes within a week. Adding the sugar makes this a 5-star recipe as it tempers the sour\/acid of the lime a bit. "

Fill your cocktail shaker with a handful of ice, pour in your favorite vodka, slice and squeeze the lime right in there, add the splash of simple syrup, and shake away.

I used 1oz rum because I don\u2019t really like the taste of alcohol too much, since it\u2019s a new taste for me. But after guzzling one drink and making another, well...we\u2019ll see how I react, lol. It\u2019s just so good! It\u2019s sweet, but I like sweet. I also used a lemon for my 2nd drink due to no more lime, and it tastes good that way too. Also, I\u2019ve learned to stir the mixture before adding ice, just so the sugar dissolves a little more. But there\u2019s so much sugar that not all of it dissolving is okay. "

I went a little adventurous and rather than sugar I do stevia and I got an AHA lime+ watermelon seltzer rather than club soda. So good mom doesn\u2019t drink and she said it was good. Little known fact you can substitute club soda for any seltzer so to make it really boozy one can simply add a Truly hard seltzer or a Bud Lifht seltzer I myself like the kiwi mango truly hard seltzer\u2019s with this mojito :) thanks so much for the recipe "

Also great with a splash of black currant syrup. Looking forward to more experiments when my raspberries and blackberries come in. "

I preferred it because I do not like things to be quite so sweet. (Although I believe that 3 packs of Splenda would be equivalent to 2 tablespoons of sugar in sweetening power.) Lastly, I used a flavored rum (mine was Gator Bite satsuma rum) which added an extra dimension. I\u2019m looking forward to trying it with the other flavor rums though it would be really amazing with just regular plain white rum. "

The husman (too old for \"boyfriend,\" but not married) and I are doing a weekly \"cocktail night\" and this was the featured cocktail we experimented with for Cocktail Night #2.

If you pour it from the serving glass to a mixer and back in, the mint leaves should be evenly dispersed throughout the glass. only worth it for guests, otherwise it doesn't affect the taste at all.

Before I made this recipe, I had also done some research on Mojito\u00b4s and found one great tip online, saying not to add lime wedges since the bitter flavor from the shell would come into the drink, so I juiced the lime instead. I made this in a mason jar, so I doubled the recipe, and because I juiced the lime, I used the juice from 1.5 lime, 3 tbs simple syrup and then followed the recipe for the mint, ice, rum and club soda. The mojito turned out a little to strong for my liking, so after drinking a little bit, I then added a little bit more club soda and then it was perfect for me. I would probably add 1 ounce of rum next time (in my case 2 ounces since I double it) so it wont become to strong. "

Third, I strained some of the pulp from the lime. Instead of the sugar, put some simple syrup and muddle the lime and mint. This makes it a bit tastier.

I don't see the extra step to make the sugar into syrup unless that's your preference because if you follow the directions and muddle using the lime and mixing the suger it comes out perfect.

I muddled the 1 like wedge then added simple syrup and two more lime wedges and muddled again. I then poured that into a tall glass with ice. I used 2 ounces of white rum with 1 squished lime wedge and stirred. I added a little bit more ice then the club soda. For mine I used dried stevia leaves from my garden instead of simple syrup and it didn't change the taste at all. Then again I'm used to stevia. A solid drink for sure. "

Substituting simple syrup as some other reviewers suggested saves little time and detracts from the drink. The granular sugar, with the muddled lime and mint, adds to the sweet and complex texture. Serve with one of those wide straws and you'll want to drink these faster on a hot summer day than you can make them (which are still good without the rum, by the way). "

A local bartender gave me that tip and all of his drinks have been awesome so that's how I made mine. Also...because I was making mojitos in bulk for a large party, I squeezed the lime juice ahead of time, no muddling, and used a blender for the mint mixed with some of the juice and rum. Let the mix set for several minutes and the mint \"extract\" will come out just as well as if I'd muddled the mint. About 1.5 gallons of mojitos lasted around 30 minutes...people loved them!!! "

When it comes to making one for yourself or you friends, just use the real granulated sugar or sugar cube. Remember; muddling the ingredients together and especially the lime and mint leaves, require a good friction, grinding motion which you won't get from simple sirup!Whenever you'd be muddling sugar with citrus zests, granulated sugar is the \"secret\", it just requires a little extra effort which I think is well worth it especially when you perform in front of your buddies. Also don't worry about needing the \"real\" Cuban mint....any fresh bunch from your local store or your own yard will do. For a nice change you can even substitute fresh mint with fresh basil. Try it and let me know what you think. "

I ended up having to crush the 4th lime wedge, add a squirt of lime juice (the plastic one), add more seltzer water and a trickle more rum. In other words a taller drink to cut the sweetness. I bought my own mint plant today just to make Mojitos. I think tomorrow I am going to go buy another one - this time the variety with the fuzzy leaves. I think it will be better. "

I find that muddle-ice-rum-soda does not infuse the whole drink with the minty, limey deliciousness that I want in a mojito. I HIGHLY recommend using this recipe's directions, but muddling your mint and limes (first mint and 1 lime, then 2 more limes) in a cocktail shaker, then adding sugar, rum, and ice and shaking until your hands freeze! Pour it ALL into a glass, fill up with more ice, and top with club soda. The result is frosty and flavorful. Seriously though, as far as ingredients and proportions, this is now my only mojito recipe. Perfect!!! "

        "Review":"DELICIOUS! Light, refreshing and a perfect blend of tart and sweet. After reading a considerable amount of reviews and the suggestions given in another review by the author, Brandy, I believe the key to getting this drink perfect is to be sure to use SUPERFINE SUGAR. I was going to try both simple syrup and the sugar to see which one worked best, but I decided at the store while picking up the mint leaves to check and see if they had the superfine sugar. They did and I bought it. This is definitely the key to adding the sugar easily. I used a mortar and pestle to muddle the ingredients and the superfine sugar just melted into the lime juice beautifully and completely with zero effort. The full dissolving of the sugar meant that it was going to mix into the drink evenly and give the proper amount of sweetness in every sip. I'll continue to use the superfine sugar because it's so easy and quick. I also splurged on a beautiful bottle of white rum called Oronoco and I believe that also made a big difference. My finished drink was smooth, perfectly sweet and tart and beautiful to look at. And I'm sure it's easy to overdo it - this cocktail went down way too easily!I used a swizzle stick and stirred it every now and then to keep mixing the flavors as I sipped it. I felt like I was on vacation. This is going to be my new special summer drink and I'm going to make another one this afternoon since it's so hot outside! Thank you, Brandy! "

I have tried it and liken it to lemonade made in the same manner(I hate it!). I like having some undissolved sugar in my drink. I use a citrus reamer to juice half a lime and crush it into the the mint leaves. If I'm being lazy I use enough bottled Key West lime juice to dampen the 2TBS sugar. Also try using SPRITE (or even ginger ale) instead of club soda. MOST IMPORTANTLY MIX EVERYTHING BEFORE ADDING THE CLUB SODA\/SPRITE. Then add your carbonation and give the drink a quick swirl or two. Unless you must know exactly how much alcohol you are consuming dont bother measuring out the rum. After filling my glass near to the top with ice, I simply pour the glass about 2\/3-3\/4 of the way full of rum. "

Also, my lime tree is not mature yet, and I had some key lime juice on hand from a pie that I made, so I used that. Delicious! Now I need to buy more club soda because I finished the whole bottle. Love to have these while floating in the pool! "

I love them on the sweeter side. i added half a teaspoon more sugar than the recipe called for, but making it with what it calls for is excellent also. I would not go through the trouble of making a simple syrup as when you muddle the leaves with sugar and lime it really does start to incorporate the sugar. Even when i've gotten this drink when we go out, you still have to stir as you continue to enjoy your drink....our new summer drink for 2012!!! "

        "Review":"Very good recipe after reading many bad ones. I approached only slightly differently by making it the way a bartender would make it. I simply muddled the ingredients in a shaker, added ice, then poured the rum over it. I shook the drink, poured it straight into the glas then added a bit more ice and topped with club soda. There was no sense of granular sugar in it. I used all 4 limes in the muddling, but I rimmed the lime along the glass edge. I also added just a touch of roses lime. I think if you were making quantities, simple syrup would make it easier but it's not required for a couple of drinks if you shake it well. The only downside is that you do get a fair amount of floating mint, but I think that adds to it both in aroma and flavor. "

I also made a simple syrup to use instead of the sugar, which is how they make it at his bar. Simple syrup is 1 cup sugar and 1 cup water. Let the syrup dissolve in the water over low heat and then allow to cool. These are so refreshing on a hot day! "

I have been making these for a while now, and waited until I had fresh cut mint to use (instead of extracts, packaged leaves, etc) in order to give it a proper review. As with a lot of recipes, fresh ingredients make all the difference, and in this case take the drink from good to great! The only thing I insisted on doing different was to use simple syrup instead of sugar, to make sure it dissolved\/blended well. Proper muddling is also key to bringing out the oils of the mint leaves (found that one out the hard way). Thanks for sharing a great recipe. "

I use a shaker for this so the agave syrup mixes in. I personally prefer to use a shaker anyway. I put about 4-6 large whole basil leaves and juice of one lime in a shaker and muddle. Then added agave syrup to taste and vodka, along with ice. Shake well. Strain into tall glasses filled with ice. I add a splash of mineral water and garnish with a basil leaf. "

I like to put a bit of sugar in the glass (tall pint type) with the mint leaves as it helps to pull the oil out of the mint when muddling. I then add mint simple syrup to taste. (easy to make, just add mint to the syrup at the end of your cooking time and let steep for 15 minutes) Also you can use plain water or seltzer or sprite or whatever tickles your palate.

        "Review":"This is very good, but I think the perfect mojito needs a mint syrup (1:1 ratio of sugar or splenda to water, boil together for ~3mins, add fresh mint leaves to taste and allow to cool together before straining). I played all weekend and the mint flavor just translated better when I used the syrup. I muddled a few mint leaves with 1 lime wedge in the glass for effect, then added to taste the syrup, rum, and lime juice; ice cubes; and topped with club soda. This also cut down on the \"dirty fish tank\" effect of the drink, which never bothered me much but my husband complained about. Fun to make and very refreshing, thanks so much for sharing. "

First, with all the cleaning, separating and muddling of the mint, it takes about an hour of hard work so start early! First, I combined most of sugar with rum and club soda in jug then used remaining sugar to separately muddle mint leaves in about 5 stages (~20 leaves at a time) with lime juice. The sugar and lime really helped with the muddling. Also, I used a juice squeezer rather than muddling for several lime because it just got to be too much work to muddle that many! I finished it about 30 minutes prior to serving and it still looked great. On serving, I added to a glass on ice and added leftover mint pieces for garnish. I got lots of positive feedback on this one. Yummy! "

Using sugar instead of a simple syrup is also important, because the crystals' grit releases even more of the flavorful oils. I only had lemon-lime soda & no club soda, so I did reduce the sugar. After making & tasting it with the recipe's proportions, I did add a little more lime, mint & rum (personal preference). "

Added: I just made this again with ultrafine sugar and it is heavenly. Two tablespoons of sugar may be too much for some, but it's just right for me. Adjust the amounts of sugar, lime, and mint according to taste. The second time around, I added extra lime and muddled the sugar, lime and mint with the back of an ice cream scoop. "

We use simple syrup (equal parts sugar in the raw and water, boiled down) instead of granulated sugar because it mixes with more ease. We also just muddle one half of a lime with the mint (exactly 11 leaves), add ice, measure your rum (we use 2 ounces) and simple syrup, then shake that bad boy to death. Pour into a glass, and top with a splash of soda water. These are crazy popular at my bar. We also garnish these with a stick of sugar cane, but that is strictly for aesthetics.

I'm not much of an alcoholic beverage drinker, and this is how I use up the champagne and proseco that I accumulate as holiday gifts and party leftovers. I serve it for brunch or luncheon get togethers. Mix your own --- go straight juice or wine (kept in ice bucket). Now the mixers can add a dash of triple sec to taste. What fun! "

I made a few \"additions\" and modifications due to personal taste: I made it in a punch bowl due to the amount of people serving, so be careful to watch the measurements when using the All Recipes serving totals. We have a diabetic in our family so I made a separate batch for him that included a low sugar orange juice and mixed in a minute maid diet mango drink. For the adults I added in the left over cranberry juice and pineapple juice I had from the cranberry whip recipe I made. For the children I made a separate version (with the cranberry\/pineapple juices) but used a carbonated grape juice for the champagne. All were delicious!!! "

I found that the mid priced ones worked the best. I got a bottle of Moscato D'asti, for about $11 at a whole sale club. It is a regular sweeter white wine I like anyway. It is slightly sparkling, unlike French champagne. And, it is much sweeter than the lower priced dry sparkling wines. I also used a favorite oj without the pulp. The proportions are perfect in this recipe, just follow it exactly. "

It is best to use a generic brand cola or to leave your \"coke\" open to the point where it is slightly flat. Bar cola is rarely ever very fizzy and it is the reason it works well in the drink "

That is the recipe, and I feel there may have been a few times I took it intravenously as well. Such a simple concoction if mixed in the right proportions tastes like the nectar of the Gods, but one spirit out of proportion can have disasterous results. Get the alcohol proportions right in the first two, and all is good. after that, you won't care. If the first tastes off balance, I usually have them add a shot of Roses Lime Juice as the most effective first aid(don't waste it), and watch the second being poured and accurately measured. A word of caution: DO NOT TREAT THESE AS SHOTS. Bad things will happen. "

The \"Perfect Martini\" = Chill a Martini glass AND store the vodka in a freezer or refrigerator. Fill a steel shaker with ice then pour in a good dose of QUALITY vermouth. Shake once or twice and then pour it out the bulk of the vermouth or until the shaker first just starts to drip (if you like a dry Martini) . Now you have the perfect amount of vermouth covering the ice in the shaker. Pour in 2-3 oz vodka, (If you have the means, Begluga Export or Gold line... or) Use a good quality Vodka (Belvedere, Kettle One, Grey Goose, Russian Standard Premiums, Stoli Gold) Shake slowly so as not to bruise the vodka (infuse with air and ice chips) until you feel the steel shaker frosting up. Dump the ice out of the glass and pour the shaker contents down the inside rim of the glass. I use a 1\/4 inch thick lemon rind or if I want \"Dirty\" I go with two Queen olives freshly stuffed with Dutch BlueCheese. Skol! "

Id change very little but found two cinnamon sticks were nice, a little less sugar and a little more water or replace the extra water with orange juice and it'd be perfect. After cutting the orange in half, put the cloves in the orange halves before squeezing the orange as it becomes much harder to put the cloves in when it's already squeezed. "

For the red wine: I used a red blend (Llano signature red: Cab sav, merlot, malbec). I thought this was way too sweet. Also, I had mini mandarins, so I used 1.5 of those instead of 1 orange. In my tasting, I thought some almond would be a nice addition. I added a touch of amaretto to the mug, it tasted good. When I make again, I would use 6 tbsp brown sugar and almond slivers, or 4 tbsp brown sugar + 2 tbsp amaretto. "

It was not at all like the spiced wine I had at a German restaurant, but I added honey to make it taste okay. I want to make it again with wine I like, because it was the merlot itself that did not taste good. I hoped the spices would fix that, but it didn't. "

But that can be easily rectified by making the sugar syrup as in step 1, setting half of it aside, then continue with the recipe as written. When finished, add more of the reserved sugar syrup (or not) to taste. Forget Christmas, this is wonderful all year long! Oh, and to give this a Swedish twist, serve with raisins and\/or slivered almonds in the mug. Absolutely divine. "

I didn't use sugar, but rather six packets of Splenda. I realized this was about 2\/3 the sweetness that I would have gotten using the amount of sugar in the recipe, but I figured I could add more later, if need be. (6 packets were just right.) I did strain the gl\u00fchwein before serving and then just put it back in the pot and set it on the kosher setting on the stove. After all, I didn't want the alcohol to cook off. "

We made this drink with an expensive bottle of Merlot, then did a second batch with a cheaper brand (Barefoot Merlot...$5.99 a bottle). The cheaper brand DEFINITELY had the RIGHT taste and smell! Reminded us of being at the Christmas Market at Marienplatz in Munich -after the following changes. The things I did different was scale back the sugar to 1\/2 cup and used orange juice instead of water (and still used the whole orange) per bottle.

I kept getting compliments. That said, I used 2 bottles of cabernet sauvignon by Yellow Tail. I then doubled everything else but may have added a bit more sugar since I didn't measure exactly. The only thing I changed was I used mulling spices that I picked up from the store. I just put those in a large tea ball and let them steep. I also combined all the ingredients at once because I wanted a good portion of the alcohol to burn off. Everyone I know loves this and I give out the recipe pretty much every time I make it. "

Certainly, this is much better served hot; if you don't drink it quickly enough and it gets cold, it doesn't taste nearly as good. I made this exactly as written. However, the sugar\/water mixture didn't get \"thick and syrupy\" within 30 minutes; maybe it's my elevation (6200 feet), or maybe I didn't have my \"simmer\" set high enough. I hope that wasn't a crucial part of the recipe. I also didn't get all the juice out of the orange halves (squeezed by hand), but they were pretty large, so I got a lot of juice anyway. But thanks for an introduction to this kind of drink; perhaps I'll find one that will \"wow\" me someday. Oh, and the wine I used was a 2006 California Shiraz (by Charles Shaw). "

Everyone wanted the recipe, and it helped them warm up after a night on a float. (I suspect it helped us all *float* home, too!) The only other change was that after the sugar\/water\/orange peel mixture boiled, I turned the stove off and let it sit while I did an errand. When I returned, the mixture had thickened. Since I used a small saucepan, I heated half of the wine in the microwave then added everything into a large thermos. My husband said he could smell it when the thermos was opened! Oh, since there was already orange juice in it, I also added about 1\/2 cup of orange liquer for an extra shot of cheer. Will definitely serve again! Thanks for the recipe. "

We started with 2 bottles of Kendall Jackson Pinot Noir, and it was gone within about 15 minutes. We actually had to go to the grocer for three more bottles of Pinot Noir! It was amazing! "

I made a triple recipie of this for a party, using Tropicana orange juice instead of the water, and I reduced the white sugar a bit and added just a little bit of brown sugar. It did not get syrupy, but with that much orange juice I didn't expect it would. I tripled the cinnamon sticks, but still only used 10 cloves, and only one orange. For wine, I used 1 and 1\/2 bottles of Sawmill Creek shiraz. I added 2 bottles while it was on the stove, and then kept it warm in the crock pot, adding another 1\/2 bottle directly to the crock pot (the full 3 bottles wouldn't fit). The porportions worked out perfectly though. Very yummy, and very cozy drink.... will definitely make again! "

It was gone within 30 minutes, doubling the recipe just wasn't enough (for 16 people). Everyone raved as they downed this rosy-warm aromatic drink. Have back-ups pre-made. The trick I used with the crockpot was adding 2 inches of water, turning it on high with a lid while the oranges\/cloves simmered in the oj mixture (not water) to get it nice & hot. So, instead of adding the wine to the stovetop pot, I dumped everything in the crockpot after the oranges were finished simmering. This worked great but I knew I was in trouble when it only filled it halfway. I used Yellowtail Shiraz\/Cabernet as someone else suggested. Too good! Will make as often as I can. "

If you can get the wine \"Bulls Blood\" in your area, (I believe it is a Hungarian red wine) it absolutely will make the best gluehwein! When I make my Gluehwein, I slice the orange and place the cloves within the orange. Everyone has there own way of making it though, that is just my preference. Try this, you will LOVE IT! "

The citrus tends to get a bit of pulp into the wine, so strain it before serving if you mind pulp. Also, if you're serving this to people who don't usually drink wine, I recommend using a sweet wine like Shiraz -- I used a (dry) burgundy and even with the sugar, the initial taste was quite tart when the wine was served hot. This keeps well refrigerated -- just warm in the microwave when you want to serve it. "

The people who did not rate them well need to learn that this is the kind of recipe you tweek to your liking. If you think it has too much alcohol or not enough, change the amount! For my preferences, this margharita was perfect. Also, none of us thought it was too sweet. There's enough techila to tone down the sweetness in the other ingredients. Just play with it. If you are worried about the frozen strawberries with syrup being too sweet, use only 4 oz of them and add either plain frozen or fresh berries. It's not hard people. Don't lower the rating of the recipe by several stars just because all of us have different taste buds. "

My only \"gripe\" is that the strawberry flavor was somewhat lacking (it's very subtle, IMHO). I think I'll tinker with the ratio of frozen strawberries next time to see what I can come up with. :) TIP: Moisten the rim of you glass with a lime wedge or cut strawberry half, THEN dip in sugar (powdered, granulated or large crystals). The fruit does double duty.... Not only does it allow the sugar to adhere to your glass (the fruit \"juice\" is sticky), it also serves as a cute garnish! Thanks for sharing, JTWTECH!

We ended up using the same amount of tequila and triple sec, but increased the strawberries to 16oz and the limeade concentrate to 6oz. This is just like the strawberry margaritas at our favorite Mexican restaurant in town, we will definitely be making this again and again!!! "

The tequila that I used was Jose Cuervo Gold. I could not find the strawberries with syrup so i used frozen strawberries with sugar. You might also want to add strawberry syrup to make it sweeter. Overall great recipe. "

I made slight variation keeped the amount of alcohol the same, but used Gran Gala instead of triple sec its higher quality, added 8-12 oz unsweetened strawberries because that is what I had, so I added 1\/8-1\/4 sugar. And added only 3 oz of limeade. And added enough water so it would blend. It was so popular that we ran out of tequila we made 5 batches so if your having a party make sure you have lots of strawberries, tequila, and ice! "

A full cup of booze goes in with 3\/4s of it being tequila so be sure to use a good brand. Very tasty and considerably less expensive then buying the ready to use mixes. MMMMM Think I'll have me another. "

Ich bin unverz\u00fcglich losgezogen um die Zutaten zu besorgen, mein Mann (J\u00fcrgen 54) und ich waren voller vorfreude auf einen Mai Thai Abend - back to the roots. Wir hatten Erinnerungen an wilde PartyN\u00e4chte in den 90ern. .. wie gesagt so getan. Beim mixen stellten wir , bedauerlich fest, dass dies nicht mit einem mai Thai zutun hatte. Diese Getr\u00e4nk wars laut J\u00fcrgen und mir sehr fern von einem Mai Thai. Tut mir wirklich leid Marion 0 von 10 Sternen. Wir sind entt\u00e4uscht."
