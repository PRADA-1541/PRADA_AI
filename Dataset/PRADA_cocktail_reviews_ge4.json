I mixed everything in a 5 Liter Igloo beverage dispenser and served it with orange slices and skewered pinapple and maraschino cherries. Very refreshing, but be careful because this stuff goes down way to easy... "

I used the 1\/2 cup (4 ounces) of Crabbie's Orginal Alcoholic Ginger Beer and all the other ingredients but added one more: 1 tsp of 'simple syrup' which I made by using a 1:1 ratio of water and sugar (1\/4 cup water to 1\/4 cup sugar or any equal amounts you choose) then microwaving in a glass bowl (NOT in the copper mugs!) and stirring it to dissolve the sugar. The left over simple syrup should be sealed tightly and refrigerated to be used for other recipes within a week. Adding the sugar makes this a 5-star recipe as it tempers the sour\/acid of the lime a bit. "

We use simple syrup (equal parts sugar in the raw and water, boiled down) instead of granulated sugar because it mixes with more ease. We also just muddle one half of a lime with the mint (exactly 11 leaves), add ice, measure your rum (we use 2 ounces) and simple syrup, then shake that bad boy to death. Pour into a glass, and top with a splash of soda water. These are crazy popular at my bar. We also garnish these with a stick of sugar cane, but that is strictly for aesthetics.

I'm diabetic so I altered a little bit and doubled the recipe. For 1.5L of Chianti red wine, I used water and only half the sugar...however I used 2 oranges instead of 1 and half a grapefruit. I'm excited to keep experimenting with this base! "

        "Review":"As many others have previously said, I too have fond memories of drinking Glühwein at many a Christkindlesmarkt when I was stationed in Germany. I recall being so surprised that I liked it because I typically drink Spätlese and find red wines such as Merlot too bitter. I made this with Shiraz, as a few reviewers suggested, to keep things on the sweeter side. I also used orange juice in place of water as many reviewers suggested. I think using a cinnamon stick and whole cloves are genius as ground versions would overwhelm it. I have tried many other Glühwein recipes and been sorely disappointed, however, this tastes just like the Glühwein I remember. Thank you, Else for sharing! "

Often, I like to add a few splashes of brandy. It makes it a bit more potent, which is especially nice if your wine got a little too warm and some alcohol evaporated. I've already made this so many times, I had to make sure I put my review in. "

It was gone within 30 minutes, doubling the recipe just wasn't enough (for 16 people). Everyone raved as they downed this rosy-warm aromatic drink. Have back-ups pre-made. The trick I used with the crockpot was adding 2 inches of water, turning it on high with a lid while the oranges\/cloves simmered in the oj mixture (not water) to get it nice & hot. So, instead of adding the wine to the stovetop pot, I dumped everything in the crockpot after the oranges were finished simmering. This worked great but I knew I was in trouble when it only filled it halfway. I used Yellowtail Shiraz\/Cabernet as someone else suggested. Too good! Will make as often as I can. "
