I took the advice of other reviewers and used regular white rum in place of the 151....but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. I even made a rum free batch for the kids and they loved it! Perfect paired with jerk marinated chicken and Caribbean rice & beans. Will definitely be making again! ",

I also used fresh lime juice and added a splash of orange bitters. Additionally, I made a smaller batch using club soda in place of the rum for the non-drinkers. It was obviously less exciting, but still a pretty decent fruit punch. ",

I looked this up after having a Rum Punch at a Jamaican restaurant. They used Wray & Nephew overproof rum, which I didn't have but most likely would have worked better. ",

My friends mostly liked it (although a little on the sweet side) but everyone agreed that it still didn't pack much of a punch. The high rating is for a simple yet decent punch that can be thrown together in a pinch w/a few inexpensive ingredients. Lots of potential for it to be doctored up w/different fun ingredients. ",

It's now a standard at my bar set-up, along with other pop & mixers, beer and wine. I split it into two batches -- one spiked and one virgin, and don't bother with the punch bowl, I just use large pitchers. My only warning is to pour the pop in small batches and don't stir it too much, as the carbonation seems to react with the juice concentrate and really fizzes up a lot. I had a sticky mess to clean up the first time -- learned my lesson after that. Great punch - definitely recommend! ",

I found the frozen limeade mix at Kroger, the Kroger brand, and it was in 12oz. can's. I doubled the recipe with a good blanco tequila and cointreau instead of triple sec. I added about 3 1/2 cans of filtered water in the limeade container. I added a splash of orange juice to finish it. It is OUT OF THIS WORLD!! I would have never imagined! I am totally sharing this recipe with family and friends. SO glad to have found this recipe and tweaked it for my liking ?? ",

But the flavor was actually really great. Might try some agave nectar next time. Also, a squeeze of fresh lime juice and maybe a splash of OJ really brightens it up and it's so much better than squeezing a million fresh limes for each drink! I've stocked up on a big quality bottle of the tequila I prefer, a big bottle of Cointreau and a few containers of brand name limeade concentrate, for the ease of it. I'm always on the front porch now that the weather's warm and it's always classy to be able to offer a cold drink. If you're not a margarita snob, definitely try this easy, yummy recipe!

The only difference is simply limeade uses sugar instead of high fructose corn sugar used in most frozen limeade. Either way, these are great. Also, you can splurge and use Cointreau instead of Triple Sec for a \"Deluxe\" version of this cocktail. ",

I found myself with no good limes one hot day while I was making Tacos...GASP RIGHT!! ha I always have lime aid in the freezer so....walla...The best frozen Margarita was born. I use about a Tablespoon or less of sugar per-pitcher and prefer just a splash of or no triple sec. I use 4 oz Tequila, 1/3 can frozen lime aid, sugar to taste up to 1 tablespoon, splash of triple sec (or none), 2 cups of ice. Place all in that order in a blender. Puree until smooth...Everyone loves these. Now go get out on the deck on a nice hot day and ENJOY! ",

It was so easy and the margaritas are wonderful!!! I did not fill the blender with ice all the way to the top with the first batch (was afraid it would overflow), and the margaritas were too strong. The following batches were perfect. Recommend making before the guests arrive (especially if your blender is really loud), put in a plastic jug and put in the ice in your beverage tub. It keeps better than you would expect. Make sure you buy enough limeade! Would recommend to calculate 1 batch per every 4 guests, more if there are no other beverages (we used up 4 batches for 18 people, despite offering also wine, beer, and non-alcoholic drinks) ",

What I now do is use the can of limeade; then use 1/2 can water; 1/2 can - ok - maybe a little more of tequila; almost 1/2 a can of triple sec or a good Orange liquire; then I mix in a blender with no ice. Pour into a salt rimmed glass over ice; and then add 1 shot of Ameratto to the glass. WOW- it sure does knock it up a noch and is super good. Thanks so much for this recipe. - PS - you can use Kosher Salt instead of 'Margarita Salt' its easier to find and cheaper. ",

Tired of the same old pizza and cake routine, I decided to make fajitas and margaritas, so that all the grown-ups could enjoy themselves too! This margarita recipe was fantastic and a hit. I followed the recipe exactly and added some fresh lime juice and an ounce of OJ for those that wanted margaritas on the rocks. I also made several frozen batches with whole fresh mango chunks blended in, finished with a Chambord float on top, like one reviewer mentioned. It was amazing! The margaritas went well with the Avocado, Tomato and Mango Salsa on this site. Thanks for the great recipe. ",

I enjoyed this slushy, slightly tart, and just-sweet-enough concoction with tortillas and salsa. It was better than the restaurant margaritas I've tried. It was tastier than a prepackaged mixer without any extra work. Omit the tequila and triple sec and add a splash of orange juice for an alcohol-free treat that can be enjoyed by everyone! ",

The secret is filling the blender with ice, and then the addition of the frozen limeade concentrate makes it the perfect consistency for a blended margarita. This tasted authentic, and exactly like the drinks I have ordered and enjoyed from Mexican restaurants. I am hooked on this recipe now! Great, delicious, easy to make, and much cheaper than a premade mix - I'll never make margaritas any other way again. ",

I bought a margaritaville frozen concoction machine recently and wanted to take it down to my sister's for our annual 4th of July party at her house by the beach. I searched for a recipe and found this one. I am so glad I picked this one, because these were a huge hit at the party! I ended up being the bartender for the night and made batch after batch of these delicious drinks. Some people thought the limeade a bit too tangy so I used 1/2 the can of limeade and squeezed a tad of fresh lime in the mix. They were perfect!! This will be the drink now for our 4th of July party from now on! ",

So, using the idea of limeade from this recipe, I decided to make fresh limeade to replace the frozen concentrate. I used the honey limeade recipe found here, to which I added about 2-3 tbs of fresh-squeezed orange juice. I first poured the liquor and then kinda eyeballed the amount of limeade, serving it on the rocks. It's a great alternative if you're feeling ambitious enough to go homemade once in a while. ",

Freeze the watermelon and add with the ice when making these margaritas. Freezing is key to keeping the drink a good thick frozen consistancy. Also, you can de-seed then puree and freeze in ice cube trays for later use. Just pop them in a zipper bag to keep fresh tasting. These will be the hit at your BBQ or next party! ",

Ever since I found this recipe my search for the perfect Margarita has ended! In my former life I spend many, many years bartending in a popular restaurant know for it's signature drinks. Despite that experience I struggled to duplicate a decent margarita at home. I didn't have the secret spice mix, none of the (expensive) mixes out there even came close, and messing with all of those limes and sugar was, well, a mess! Search no more folks, this is sooo easy and makes the perfect Margarita to boot. Ialways add a splash of O.J. to the blender. To make it \"golden\" sub Gran Marnier or Cointrau (sp?) or a combo of both for the Triple Sec. In the summer I often replace half of the ice with frozen chunks of watermelon and it is devine!

I made one batch with limeade (I cut the 12-oz can in half lengthwise and stuck the second half in a freezer bag, back in the freezer!) and used 1½ or 2 trays of ice cubes... Well, they were a little strong! The second batch somehow turned out stronger... Nice to drink while watching our daughter playing in her wading pool in 90-degree weather in early May! I also made a batch with pink lemonade instead of limeade and it turned out wonderful as well. Seriously, thanks so much for sharing this recipe, Katherine! ",

Make sure you put ice right to the top of the blender or else the limeade will make it taste too bitter. Also make sure you blend it long enough so that it's more of a slushy constistency than snow cone consistency. And to serve, use a margarita glass, cut a lime in half and run the cut part over the edge of the glass, then dip the rim in salt and garnish with half a lime slice. Perfection. ",

Only difference, we've always used a teaspoon of sugar or two instead of triple sec - not a big difference. Also, we usually call them \"drunk margaritas,\" because you can make them well, even when you're drunk. Since we use the 6 oz. can of limeade, you just dump that over the ice in the blender, then fill the limeade can with tequila then add the sugar. Trust me, these are fool-proof, and you really can make them perfectly even when you're drunk. (Though maybe you wouldn't really notice.) ",

Turn on the blender and let the party begin! Much easier then using a measuring cup. If this is too strong then simply fill the can half way with tequilla and add triple sec to make the can 3/4 full.

I couldn't decide which one to use, so when I mixed up the batch I used half of both vodkas. Because it's such a simple recipe, it can be made ahead of time. Use a mason jar with measurement lines, and just fill to each line for however many servings you need. Make it the night before and store in the fridge. When you're ready to serve it, it's nice and cold. Just shake and stir. This is really convenient if you are bringing some drinks to a get-together. ",

This is the measurements that we used: 1 1/2 cups citron vodka, 1 cup Blue Curacao, 3 cups Sour mix (which Sweet and Sour is the same thing) and about 3/4 of a 2 litter bottle of 7up, then we floated Lemon slices on the top (which is so cute because they turned blue as the night when on). We ended up filling the glass dispenser about three times cause everyone loved it. ",

I used the slightly higher end orange liquor by DeKuyper 3/4 cup, Rose lime syrup because I wanted to get rid of it (will probably use agave nectar or simple syrup next time) and a three part mixture of freshly squeezed lime, lemon and orange juices 3/4 cup. Very, very good! For myself I could probably handle the full booze amount, but this is for a family gathering and double recipe with lesser booze amounts made two 750 ml bottles so perfect. Glad I found this recipe. Thank you! ",

            "Review": "It’s likely those that are complaining it tastes too strong of tequila are probably using cheap tequila (like Jose Cuervo) which will burn your throat and taste like lighter fluid going down. Good tequila should be 100% agave so if you see that on the bottle then you are good to go. Tequila only needs to be 51% agave to be called tequila so the cheap still will fill the rest of tequila with a “mixto” aka cheap alcohol, which is why you feel like garbage the next day after taking shots of Cuervo. You should be able to get a decent bottle for around $25-$30. The only thing I did different to this recipe was use Cointreau instead of Triple Sec and it tasted great! ",

The first batch I made, I did use the 2 cups of tequila and it was strong!!!! Too strong!!! From there on out, I only used one cup and it was still pretty strong using that. All in all, they were good. My guest called it top restaurant quality strength margaritas. I had to give only 4 stars because I have no idea why the recipe calls for 2 cups of tequila when it only needs one. ",

The fresh lime juice gives them the right balance of flavors to taste authentic and fresh. I will use this recipe a lot! UPDATE: I make simple syrup (1 part water to one part sugar, heated until combined, then cooled) instead of \"sweetened lime juice\", because I don't really know what that is! ",

            "Review": "I don’t like wine. Made merely palatable by most sangrias I have had. It all tastes like rotten grapes. But my sister in-law gave me this bottle of red wine that sat unused for over a year. But during the social isolation period of 2020, I figured what the $&@? I will make some sangria. So I had to use what I had in the house. Bourbon in place of brandy, lemonade mix (in a cup of water, used 1/3 c in recipe) in place of frozen concentrate, and no soda water which I always thought watered it down anyway. Results.... amazing! A use of wine I can get behind. I added a tablespoon of sugar dissolved in a cup of the mix the next day, to break up the tartness from the lemon. If you prefer a sweeter sangria you will want to add some sweeter elements, this is bold, reminiscent of port. ",

I follow the recipe exactly... I use inexpensive red blend wines, doesn't matter what kind, they all come out great... I don't add the white sugar, you don't need to... and I use a single serve bottle of 7UP (instead of carbonated water) for the carbonation and sweetness and I add it right before serving... I also cut up all kinds of fruits to add, not just the orange, lemon, & lime as the recipe lists... I use apples, strawberries, peaches, etc... Again, it doesn't really matter... this recipe allows you the freedom to play around without screwing it up AT ALL... I will say making it the night before does seem to make a difference to the complexity of the flavors... But I've also made it and served it 15 minutes later because someone asked me to make 'that awesome sangria' and it's still fantastic!! ",

Threw some frozen strawberries in too. Made it the day before (added the ginger ale just before serving). It was delicious... and dangerous! LOL! This stuff tastes like punch but packs quite a punch! I'll definitely make this again. Next time, I'll cut the lemons, limes, and oranges into smaller pieces... while they looked pretty in rounds, they made it difficult to put some fruit in to each person's glass, and the smaller fruit was stuck at the bottom of the pitcher. By cutting them smaller it will be easier to use a slotted spoon to put some fruit in each person's glass before/after pouring. ",

I used 2 bottles of semi-sweet red and 1 bottle sweet red wine (nothing fancy!) and halved the sugar. I let this sit overnight and added 2 cups of carbonated water (used my Soda Stream) in the morning. I tripled the recipe for approx. 15 people and this was a huge HIT. It was gone only halfway through the party and people were asking me to make more! The flavors and fruit come together beautifully in a rich, deep red color. I was not expecting this to be so strong though, you can't really taste how strong it is. Definitely a creeper! I think I could easily make this using half the triple sec and brandy and still have it taste delicious. I plan on adding more fresh fruit next time around. Great recipe! ",

The club soda makes it a spritzer lighter version so some folks didn’t use it. After cutting the fruit I sprinkled it with sugar and let it soak a few hours then I made the sangria and poured it all in a large pitcher. Yummm ",

For the carbonated water, I used Topo Chico, a locally popular sparkling mineral water of Mexican origin. Since I was making enough for a big party, using a 3 gallon glass vessel, I made the \"base\" for this sangria, multiplying the recipe x3, to generously serve 25 guests. The \"base\" includes ALL ingredients EXCEPT the carbonated water, i.e. Topo Chico. To maximally maintain carbonation for each refill of the pitcher, I ladled one-third of the liquid \"base\" mixture (approximately 5 cups) into the pitcher, adding the slices of lime/lemon/orange, and 2 cups Topo Chico. To serve or refill each guest, a beverage wineglass was half-filled with ice. I did not garnish with maraschino cherries as I do NOT use these food aberrations. This beverage was a party hit, with many compliments and no left-overs. ",

I did not and would not recommend adding the optional cups of white sugar unless you want to give your guests an even more excruciating headache in the morning. Trust me it’s sweet enough.

I attempted a version with rum and was quickly told to stick to the brandy version. I cheat a bit and add the Costco brand sangria with sweet red wine since I prefer a sweeter version. I started with the original recipe and have tweaked it over the years with different flavored brandy i.e. peach, apricot, cherry, blackberry, you get the point. It’s much better when you let it sit overnight. It’s absolutely delicious and will sneak up on you if you’re not careful. ",

I checked out this recipe and decided to make it... I quadrupled the recipe to make 24 servings (2 (12-serving) batches). I followed the recipe closely MINUS the sugar and cherries. I also omitted the club soda/ginger ale. I used Trader Joe's fresh-squeezed OJ. I also hand-squeezed 2 lemons and 2 limes per 12-serving batch; I do this because I find when you add lemons and limes sliced up, the rinds make the sangria bitter. I added fresh apples and oranges but I removed the orange rinds (same reason as mentioned above), as well as blueberries. Used Spanish table wine, triple sec and brandy, let the whole thing refrigerate for 2 days. Needless to say, every time I walked passed the bar, I watched the sangria container go down, down, down. People RAVED and said, \"Next year, you need to make more!\" A huge hit! I loved the addition of the lemonade concentrate. I used 1 can per 12-serving batch. There's enough sugar in that - you don't need to add more. YUM! I WILL be making this again! ",

Cutting the rinds off the circles seemed good, and if the circles are cut into bite size pieces then you can serve by ladelling (ladeling?) out the sangria + fruit. Definitely recommend making the day before, for taste and then it gets cold in icebox. But fine with ice cubes also. Probably not as many circles as recipe calls for, are needed. I used 1/2 as much sugar; adding the cherry juice may be good, too. ",

I have also used an inexpensive tempranillo that is really good as well. I omit the water and sugar and just add a can of regular sprite per making, so two cans when I double it. Do NOT leave out the brandy, it makes the recipe, and sometimes i add a little extra just for good measure. I also add a little splash of grenadine and some of the cherry juice from the marichino cherries. I don't always have time to let it chill overnight and usually just make it in the morning and chill for a couple of hours before serving. This is by far my favorite sangria recipe, and it's requested everywhere we go. ",

Absolutely let this recipe sit in your fridge overnight and stir it every few hours to submerge the fruit that is on top.

I leave out the lemonade concentrate (as I usually don't have access to that, and Sangria from Spain or Mexico wouldn't have it in anyway). We lived in Mexico and EVERYONE loved this. The key is making it in advance so that the flavors really meld. I always make it at least the morning of the day before I intend to serve it. You can make it earlier than that, just don't add the fruit pieces until 24-36 hours before. When we lived in Mexico, I used Rioja wine to make it (a cheapish one as you don't need high quality wine in this mixed drink). In the U.S., I have used Cabernet as I was unable to find Rioja. I usually have Sprite and club soda on hand for people to add to it themselves. Some people don't want it watered down at all and some people prefer sweeter. ",

Definitely dilute with sparkling water as suggested. I'm a heavy wine drinker and I cannot handle more than 1-2 glasses of this at most. GREAT for summer dinner parties by the pool! ",

It all fit in a really large pitcher that I have even doubling the fruit slices and the cherries you put in and I definitely made it the day before. Right before serving, I did add 1 can of cold diet ginger ale just to cut it a little bit (although it was great without it too because I had to try it!!) and also added frozen cherries as ice cubes in the glasses before pouring!

There was no leftover alcohol to store for weeks in my cupboard or measuring cups to wash. Could not have been simpler! - ONE bottle of brandy (750mL) - ONE bottle of lemon juice (443mL, standard 15 oz.) - ONE can frozen lemonade concentrate (12oz.) [The exact adjustment would have been about 1.5 cans, but since I don't drink lemonade and didn't know what I would do with that last half can, I decided to just use one.] - ONE box of Merlot (5 L, 169oz.) [The exact adjustment called for 6.75 750mL bottles. I used a $14 box of Franzia, which comes out to just under 6.66 standard bottles of wine. Close enough.] - ONE bottle of triple sec (750ML) - ONE med. jar maraschino cherries (16oz.) - 2.25 cups OJ (18oz.) - 6 limes, 6 lemons, 6 oranges - Sugar to taste Except for the OJ, I didn't have to measure anything! Sorry for the mixing of metric and imperial measurements. I used whatever measure was most common for the item. **Also, since I made it the day of in a last minute rush, I heated up a bit of wine to help dissolve the sugar faster. ",

I multiplied the recipe *4 and it was amazing. I tasted it when I put it together and the over night marinade is a must. The taste difference is night and day!! Follow the directions and you won't go wrong!! Thank you so much for the recipe! This is definite a recipe I'll keep doing. It would make my Spanish Grandma so happy if she was still here to enjoy.

            "Review": "This was absolutely delicious. I made this for the professional championship football game and all the guests, even the guys, loved it! I decided to make two separate batches. With the first (red sangria), I used merlot (you need a medium-bodied red wine), Christian Brothers brandy (cheap), and a Patron Orange Liqueur (you can find a cheaper one). For the second, I wanted to make a white sangria. With that, I used Reisling (instead of the red wine), Captain Morgan Spiced Rum (substitute for the brandy), and Peach Schapps (vs the orange liqueur). Per the recommendation of other reviewers, I omitted (or you can use half of) the sugar. I chilled in the refrigerator overnight BEFORE adding the fruit. I added the fruit a few hours before the guests would arrive (I added oranges, lemons, limes, grapes, strawberries, and apples). Again, absolutely delicious. I can't wait to have another event so I can try this one again. Don't hesitate to try this recipe (with my suggestions). Enjoy!!! P.S. If your containers are plastic and aren't stain-resistant, fruit will damage it if left in overnight (specifically oranges, lemons, and limes as they are acidic). Some plastic containers even discourage adding liquor above 7.5% for that same reason. I purchased glass, 2.5 gallon pitchers for this. Worth it!! ",

I only make a few changes and it always turns out amazing and gets the whole family real drunk. What I do: 1. I don't care if the wine is dry or sweet, I just buy the cheapest stuff I can find that isn't boxed. I taste it. If its really sweet, I cut pack a bit on the orange juice. If it isn't so sweet I keep the OJ the same. 2. Since the first batch, I NEVER add cherries (just kinda tasted weird and added their syrup to the recipe) or lemons/limes (too sour---I like to eat my fruit as I'm drinking the sangria)... 3. So I add more oranges and if I know it's all gonna be gone soon, I add apple slices (DO NOT add them if you aren't gonna be drinking it all the next day...cos the longer they are in there the slimier they get). 4.I also never add the sugar (it's sweet enough) or carbonated water (detracts from the taste/my sweet buzz). Always, no mater how much you want to drink it now, wait til the next day to drink it. ",

I will juice oranges if I have them on hand, if not, then orange juice will do. No sugar, that's what the fresh fruit is for.

I read the reviews and made some changes considering the crowd at the party. I had rum at home so I used that instead of brandy. Since my mother in law likes sweet drinks I didn't cut the sugar completely but used half of what the recipe called for. I used ginger ale instead of soda water and waited until the party to add that so that it wouldn't be flat (You can always add more if you think it's still dry and taste more like wine) I made it a night before and let it sit overnight. I took some of the oranges and lemons out in the morning so it wouldn't be too citrusy. I added apples and strawberries in the morning as well. Make sure to at least double the recipe since it's gonna be the most popular drink at the party! ",

I made 3 times the recipe but accidentally added a little too much brandy(1/2 cup to be exact). Again its for 3 times the recipe. Everyone loved it. I didn't add any sugar nor the mineral water. I found it sweet enough and don't really like fizz. I made my recipe with spanish brandy and spanish wine(rioja) and added small slices of cantaloupe. It goes great with fruit. Thank you so much for the recipe. It is very authentic. ",

I use blackberry brandy and the cheapest bottles of wine. I also let it sit in the fridge THEN freeze. Why? I have large parties and never know how much of this to make. So I make six batches and freeze. I put a frozen section into my punch bowl and pour Sierra Mist over the top and it gets slushy. (Alcohol doesn't really freeze solid.). I then add fresh oranges and raspberries. (I have also added fruit at stage one and frozen it. That allows the berries to soak up the alcohol; I prefer fresh berry taste vs. laden with brandy.) Making it ahead allows me to focus on other things the week of the party, knowing my Sangria is done. Everyone asks me for this recipe. I claim it as my own. :) ",

Definitely make it the night before for best taste. If you have leftovers after your event I suggest removing the fruit. ",

I am in Mexico for the winter, so we don't have the limeade concentrate anywhere. Otherwise, I followed the recipe almost exactly. I only put in four tablespoons of sugar and it was better without the sparkling water I added to the top of the glasses on the first round. The first time I made it, I used a Pinot Noir and it was perfect. The second time I made it, I used a Malbec. A little dryer and darker in color. I will stick with the Pinot for this recipe. I did not use cherries, but added a plum, a peach and strawberries to the citrus. I doubled the recipe for 8 people and everyone loved it. I didn't realize there were so many recipes for Sangria. This one was fine and you really can't make a mistake, unless you make it too sweet. ",

It's the ONLY sangria I'll drink--better than anything I've ever had in a restaurant and better than any other recipe I've tried.

I typically use blackberry brandy and a merlot and I don't like it sweet, so I skip the sugar.

I added sliced apples, frozen strawberries and frozen blueberries to this the first night. The second night, I pulled all of the citrus and apples out and added a cinnamon stick and two mixed fruit cups to slightly alter the flavor. I used cheap Christian Brothers VS brandy and BOTA box Shiraz (which I love anyway), plus triple sec. It tasted FANTASTIC, but I wasn't feeling more than a little buzzed after several glasses. Maybe I'll skip the ginger ale next time. ;) ",

I always make it the night before to let the flavors meld. I make it for parties, so I end up 6x the recipe. I used to use bottled wine- however tried it with the boxed wine and it is still delicious! Thanks for the recipe!! ",

So delicious and strong but not too strong. the changes I made: 1/4 cup sugar; gingerale added just before serving; chilled w/out fruit for 24 hrs. prior (added the fruit 9 hrs, prior to serving); added the cherry juice from the cherry jar; only 1/2 cup lemon juice. LOVED it! thank you for sharing and thank you to all the other reviewers for helping me pick his recipe :) oh, I used a nice orange liqueur instead of triple-sec...taste better ",

I followed the recipe but with a few minor changes: I added an apple, a pear, and a pineapple (with the juice). I used a blackberry brandy and triple sec. I left out the sugar (it's sweet enough without it. If some prefer a sweeter sangria, add a shot of triple sec to the glass before serving). I let it sit in the fridge for over 24 hours and added seven-up just before serving. I did add ice to it, and it didnt seem to water it down at all. When I ran out, I just poured in more wine, brandy and triple sec and it was almost as good as the original batch. If you're looking for a knock-your-socks off Sangria recipe, THIS IS IT. ",

I always make a double batch and that usually isn't enough. It goes down like juice but really packs a punch! Thanks for the great recipe! ",

I doubled the recipe, (used a Tempranillo for the red wine) added tequila, about a cup, also added fresh pineapple & a firm apple, cut into small pieces, a handful of grapes & a sliced kiwi to the fruit. I substituted a jar of natural bing cherries for the maraschino cherries (no artificial coloring or sugar additives) and used the cherry syrup in place of the sugar in the recipe. Then I used sparkling water rather than the lemon-lime soda. It came out great, everyone raved about it & wanted the recipe, which I posted the original on Facebook. Thanks, HJacoby, for submitting!

Also, let it marinate for at least 24 hours; that way the flavors marry and the wine has time to mellow out. A good trick to keeping it cold without ice, use frozen cherries! Yummy!

I gave it a sample before going to get orange juice and more triple sec. It tasted great! Like all other good sangria's I've had. Got oj and ts, added, tasted again. Not as good. Left if fridge overnight. Again, not as good. The triple sec is just way to strong. Adds that synthetic orange type of flavor triple sec has and is just overbearing. I think using about 1/3 the recommended sugar is also a good idea. I didn't use carbonated water or ginger ale. Next time I make this I'm going to do it exactly to the recipe, but with only 1/4 of the oj, 1/4 the triple sec, and 1/3rd the sugar. I'm betting that will nail it. I'd advise you to taste as you add though, and add these 3 ingredients last. Dial it in how just how you like it. ",

So, because of that, we definitely ended up cutting the sweetness with some seltzer. I'd recommend no sugar and then hopefully you wouldn't need the seltzer. Overall it was good, but people definitely said it was a sweeter kind of Sangria. I used the Roijo that someone recommended. Maybe I'd try a different kind next time. Also, I would cut the rounds in half. The orange rounds were too big for the cups. ",

I didn't wait to let it sit overnight to try it and it was still good. I let it sit in the refrigerator for about 2 hours. Although, the leftover Sangria was better the next day after having sat in the fridge overnight. It would be nice to dial back the sugar even more-maybe less of the lemon frozen concentrate and replace with fresh lemon juice. The carbonated water was a nice addition and even helped dilute the sweetness of it. I added about 2 teaspoons of cinnamon, and it made it even more delicious! -Cheers! :-) ",

Used an inexpensive bottle of rioja, apples, plums, peaches and raspberries, added an orange the day of to avoid any bitterness. I also tried an inexpensive bottle of blackberry brandy, since that was one of the flavors in the wine. I also used orange juice so I wouldn't have to go out and buy triple sec just for the recipe. Turned out really yummy and perfect with something fizzy - ginger ale or club soda. Make the night before and definitely taste test it to get the right amount of sweetness and tartness. Great recipe and will continue to use! ",

(I passed on using the carbonated water and white sugar) Since we had approximately 65 guests coming I wasn't sure how to gauge it so I made 2 gallons. I prepared it 24 hours ahead of time and stored 1 gallon in a glass beverage container with a spigot, and the other gallon in a reserve pitcher. The next day, I unveiled it and you could get drunk off the fumes, which wasn't a bad thing, but I didn't want my guests hammered after one drink. So, needless to say, I poured half of it out into a reserve pitcher to use for later and what I just poured out of the serving container I filled to the top with ginger ale. Thankfully, it sweetened it up perfectly, yet you could still taste all the flavors of the brandy, the wine and fresh fruit. I would say 90% percent was all gone by the end of the party. So if you want to keep it on the sweeter side fill half of whatever container you use with Sangria and the other half with ginger ale and only add the ginger ale right before serving. CHeers! ",

The concept is you start at one house for appetizers and cocktails, proceed to another house for the main meal then finish at another house for dessert. I had the privilege of providing appetizers and cocktails. I wasn't sure what to serve because I have a few neighbors that do not indulge in alcoholic beverages. I also didn't want to spend the evening blending drinks and playing bartender and was concerned about a drink for the men so I decided to try this Sangria. OMG...this was the HIT of the evening!!! Even those who had a preference of not indulging had MORE THAN ONE GLASS! I followed the recipe but used Duplin Black River Red wine (it's a little sweeter) and I used Vernors Ginger Ale instead of carbonated water. I also pre filled the wine glasses with diced strawberries, peaches and maraschino cherries. I agree with everyone the key is to let it sit over night. The neighbors were in no rush to proceed to the next house for dinner and everyone wanted me to write down the recipe. :0) ",

I have had peach sangria that I personally like better but this one was delish. My advice... definitely don't skimp on the fruit. I 3X'd all ingredients but the fruit and I was sorry, I ended up adding more the day of the party. it will look like A LOT of fruit but it's much better!! To me Lime was the key, added that extra zing in contrast to the sweetness of the orange juice and lemonade. OH and I did what others suggested and used Ginger ale. ",

The wine we use is often a Cabernet Sauvignon, or a Shiraz. The Brandy is a must. We have used both a cheaper \"triple sec\" and the patron orange liqueur. Since it is mixed, I recommend the triple sec. We generally leave out the sugar and leave the ginger-ale separate for individual servings. Everyone LOVES it. It certainly helps the holiday spirit as well, wink wink. This will be our third year making it. A family favorite, for sure. ",

I used a 1.5L bottle of Barefoot \"sweet red\" wine as the base for this sangria and it worked really well. You don't need an expensive wine to make great sangria, after all. Since I made a double, I used a whole can of thawed lemonade concentrate. For the fruit, I used two cans of (drained) pineapple chunks, a jar of maraschino cherries, 2 oranges, 2 lemons, 2 limes and a quart of fresh strawberries. I omitted the sugar and add a 2 liter of ginger ale prior to serving. Also, I let the fruit sit overnight and pulled out most of the citrus in the morning. I froze the citrus (and a few other fruit pieces) throughout the day and then added the frozen pieces back in prior to serving. You definitely want to make it at least 24 hours in advance to let it sit and soak up all the goodness before serving. I will definitely make this again. Fantastic!! ",

I scrubbed bottles of water, froze them and they worked great to keep the sangria cold without diluting it. Sangria and frozen water bottles were placed in a large beverage server with a spout/spiget. It was perfect and it looked amazing on the Tiki Bar. ",

We also couldn't wait it to drink it over night, but it was still delicious! Maybe the good wine was the trick to that?? Anyway, thanks for the recipe. It will get good use and make many people happy :-) ",

I used *cheap* red wine and tossed in whatever random frozen fruit I had in the freezer (a berry blend, plus strawberries), in addition to the lemons, limes, and oranges. I left out the maraschino cherries and ran out of lemon juice on my second batch, so I just added more OJ. Instead of carbonated water, I used Sierra Mist. Yummy, and made a ton, too! ",

Then I started playing around, this is the beauty of this recipe: you can swap out things and get a completely different flavor. I now use frozen limeade instead of lemonade, I add the full bottles of liquor instead of half, and a lot of fruit. It's great after it's chilled a bit in the fridge, but it's FANTASTIC after it's \"cured\" for 24 hours... it's hard though :) I usually fill a glass 3/4 full then top off with either Mountain Dew, Sierra Mist, or a fruity pop for a little fizz. Just watch it, it sneaks up on you :) ",

It was just delicious, not too sweet or too tangy, just perfect. He wants me to make it every weekend. This is the first sangria I've ever had that I like. I made according to directions except I used raspberries instead of cherries, eliminated the sugar and used Sprite instead of carbonated water per other reviewers' suggestions. I also quartered my fruit and let everything but the sprite sit in a pitcher overnight in the fridge. Will be making a double batch next time! Thanks so much for this great recipe! ",

Add a bunch of sugar to hide awfulness, and serve cold and fast to get the party started! American sangria recipies are much better, and far more refined. This one is a great starter! Everyone should try different add-ons. I hate brandy, so I used spiced rum instead. I've also sloshed a little Cointreau in before. I've added pomegranate juice, pomegranate seeds, blood orange slices, blackberries, cherries and even ginger ale (reduce the sugar if you try that.) Sangria is a great chance to try some unusual fruits to jazz up the look if nothing else; just stay away from overbearing flavors. ",

Never had Sangria so I'm not sure what this is supposed to taste like...but it's pretty darn good!! Hubby and I are sure enjoying it! Maybe there won't be any left for our guests hehe. Made the recipe as written using Cabernet and a sweet red wine, no sugar but dumped in the entire jar of cherries, and ginger ale (I prefer my drinks a little sweeter). I did as one of the other reviewers suggested and removed the citrus fruits the next day but left the cherries in-yum! Nice recipe that I see could be easily tweaked for personal preferences. Thanks!

Read through the reviews and made only one or two tweaks...left out the sugar, allowed guests to add ginger ale as opposed to carbonated water to their own glasses per their own taste, and sliced up some strawberries, blackberries and apples to add to the citrus. Tossed in some frozen grapes to each glass to act as ice cubes and there you have it. I was having a paella party (try the Paella I recipe incidentally, you won't be disappointed in that one either) and even the men drank this as opposed to beer. Only mistake was not quadrupling the batch, made only as double and it was gone in no time! ",

I tripled it to fit in my beverage server nicely, and I ran out of triple sec the third go round, so I added more OJ and let it sit overnight. I will say that it tasted great immediately, so I\"m not sure if it sitting overnight is really that crucial to this recipe. I took the fruits out in the morning, and added fresh fruit prior to serving with some ginger ale. Next time I will try Blackberry brandy, as I had some last weekend and it was amazing in the Sangria. ** Be warned: this is very strong if you do not dilute with ginger ale or club soda. The way I made it was wonderful! I will make this again and again. It's the best recipe I\"ve found. ",

We made it the night before and let it sit overnight (a full 24 hours) before adding the ginger ale, it was absolutely perfect! We made 15 batches of both this red and another white sangria, and this one was gone before the end of the night! I will definitely be making it again. ",

Read the recipes that said it should really rest 24 hours and so I was a little concerned because I made it in the morning for an evening dinner party. Even with all those changes and letting it rest abour 8 hours, it turned out delicious! The whole pitcher was gone. Didn't add the carbonated water or the cherries- didn't care for them and the sangria still tasted great. Thanks for the recipe! ",

I use the citrus fruit as recommended by the recipe, but it would probably be great with green apples instead, as suggested by another reviewer. Because I like to keep it \"dry\" rather than sweet, I add carbonation with lemon-lime flavored seltzer water instead of 7up. This one is definitely a keeper! ",

I did not add any fruits (no sliced lemon, no sliced lime, etc) until it had been marinating in the fridge for about 12 hours. Then 4 hours before serving, I added diced apple (1 red, 1 green), diced strawberries, diced lemon, diced lime, and blackberries. Instead of carbonated water, as I poured each drink I topped it off with a little Ginger Ale (in some cases I used Fresca, which was my personal favorite) and put a few extra blackberries and diced apples as a garnish. It was light, refreshing, and DELICIOUS!! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this recipe!!! :) ",

Next time I won't add the extra lemon juice or lemon slices. I think it might have helped to make it a little too sour. I wasn't sure if I should let this sit out all night without being in the refrigerator but my container was too big to sit in the fridge so I took the advice of another review and stuck it in a ice chest with some ice overnight. Next time I might try apricot brandy because I like my sangria a little more fruity tasting and I don't think blackberry brandy is that much different than regular brandy. I forgot to add the sparkling water. I agree with other post. It doesn't need it. ",

We used blackberry flavored brandy and cut the amount in half since the original recipe was too strong for us. We substituted limeade and lime juice for the lemon juice and lemonade and thought it was so much better this way. We used cheap Spanish Rioja wine and did not use the sugar. Definite thumbs up from us, and we'll be making this all summer long! ",

But I wanted to try something a little different, and convinced my wine snob husband to do the same. I made this exactly as directed, the only difference being that I didn't see the need to add soda to the drink. I can see that if one is not accustomed, adding a little soda could make it go down easier. I made it a day ahead, and we had it as a weekend cocktail--very tasty! I reminded my husband that I would order something similar at a bar, served in a tall glass with crushed ice, a straw, & garnished with a cherry or to, and happily pay 8 bucks. In fact, I think that's how I'll serve it in the future. Great summertime cocktail! ",

Strawberries, pomegranite, pineapple plus the oranges, lemon, and lime. And I used the advice of others and top it off with a splash of Gingerale. Thank you for such a great recipe. ",

I cut back the lemons and limes by half and removed them after a few hours vs overnight (otherwise it gets very sour tasting). I have used limeaid (instead of lemonaid-can use either), always use gingerale (vs sugar and tonic water) and **blackberry brandy** (my favorite ingredient so I add about 1/2 C more). This is fabulous anytime of yr and great \"on the rocks\". My family & friends beg me to make for ALL gatherings now....so I always double the recipe. You will love this recipe even if you don't modify anything...enjoy!! ",

All in all, this is an absolutely delicious recipe, and an oh so beautiful color! Don't forget to eat the fruit out of it the next morning. Mm mm good! Sangria is traditionally a recipe from Spain (yumm...) and, this recipe is pretty accurate. The only real difference between this and a legitimate Spanish sangria is the sweetness, which probably comes from the addition of the lemonade concentrate (and also the sugar, which I've already mentioned, but nobody said it was illegal to like your booze sweetened!)

Then I took 6 ice cube trays and dispensed half of the mixture into the trays. The following morning, I popped the frozen cubes back into the tea jug, added a can of sprite and gave it a stir! It was very yummy but I do have one complaint. While I was inside getting all the food ready to serve, it disappeared! I only got to have one glass :( Will be making often this summer! Thank you ",

We used Pinot Noir instead of dry red wine, Appleton Rum VX instead of brandy, pink frozen lemonade concentrate instead of regular and ginger ale instead of the carbonated water. Oh and Grand Marnier (triple sec). Like some of the other reviews….it is very…very important to let rest a minimum of a day. The only issue we had was that we could only make one pitcher. Therefore we are on our way to replenish our ingredients and buy a bigger container. ",

I also continued to have it for the next two days (I made a bit too much), and it still tasted good. I love this recipe. I don't use brandy because I don't like the taste of brandy. Sometimes I throw in the ingredients without measuring, and it tastes good regardless because all of the ingredients work well. I usually leave the cherries out too. I just thought it was a lot of fruit and they weren't necessary for me. Instead of carbonated water, I add ginger ale sometimes. Be sure to add it at the last minute though if you want bubbles. ",

I put in only 1/6 of a cup of lemonade concentrate and eliminated he maraschino cherries as well as the sugar. I found the fruit slices overwhelmed my pitcher, but I like them in the glasses. I fished the majority of the fruit of the pitcher before serving. I then sliced fresh lemon and orange slices and placed them in each glass and placed one on the rim of each glass as a beautiful garnish. Sadly, they made it very difficult to drink and all fruit ended up in the glass. With these changes I was asked to make this cocktail for every family function. Only after a double batch can put up with my in-laws. : ) ",

I used limeade instead of lemonade as we found it a bit too lemony the first time. I added club soda instead of carbonated water right before serving and did not add sugar or cherries as it was plenty sweet enough. Another change I made was to add frozen grapes before serving to keep it cool and added 2 more oranges for more fruit to munch on. This is so good and refreshing on a hot summer day you will want to keeping drinking it but it hits you harder than you realize. We were already feeling it after the first glass, so be warned! :) Thank you so much for this recipe! ",

            "Review": "It is no wonder why this has 5 stars it is amazing! If you have a big enough punch bowl, I recommend tripling the batch for larger groups. A single batch would be good for a group of 4 anymore and you want to double or triple it. I tripled it for a party of 15 and it was gone in about 2 hours. So if your party-goers enjoy sangria make a lot. The key is letting it sit over night in the fridge. Also one other tip to save on wine is Traders Joes – 2 Buck Chuck works great- I have used the Merlot, Zinfandel, Cabernet Sauvignon and the Shriaz and got great result. (I do not recommend Chianti that other Sangria recipies call for, I think it always comes out too sweet.) I never have any leftovers of this when I have a party. I never use the sugar I think it would be too sweet and I always have two litters of club soda for people to add to it if they like, but I don’t mix it in the bowl. Also if you can take some of the lemon aid, maybe a little bit of water, some OJ and fruit and make an ice ring the night before to float in it so you don’t have to dilute it was ice. ",

I used fresh squeezed orange and lemon juices when it called for that. i also used clementines instead of oranges, the flavor is so much better I think. I only used 3 rounded tbsp sugar as Im not a sweet drink person. I added 2 fresh nectarines and 2 cups fresh pineapple. I used sprite instead of club soda or gingerale as I had omitted some of the sugar. This was truly an excellent Sangria and several people insisted on the recipe before they left. It was a serious hit. You wont be dissappointed. ",

I used all the wine and most of the brandy and triple sec. I added the ginger ale before serving and only used about a 1/2 a bottle (wanted to add more so that it would serve more people but the taste testers said it was great and not to add any more). I did not use sugar and made it the night before. I should have made the serving for 60 or even more because it went fast. Will absolutly make again, and I dont even like wine!! ",

I think I'll make it again and cut back a little on the brandy and triple sec. *FOLLOW UP* - I made this recipe again, this time using rum instead of the brandy. I cut back just a tad on the rum and triple sec, and used the ginger ale in place of the carbonated water. HUGE improvement. I would say this is now a 4 star recipe. Also, do not like maraschino cherries so I used strawberries instead. ",

I have adapted the fruits some and use nectarines, apples, and oranges in the mix and add a slice of lemon to the edge of the glass so that the citrus rides with every sip. I have used this recipe to make sangria for a lot of summer parties and everyone just loves it. Allowing to sit overnight/over 12 hours is definitely key. I have adapted the recipe slightly, and this is what I've found really brings out all the flavors. I mix the fruit with the brandy, sugar, and triple sec 2 days beforehand. Then the next day I add the orange juice, lemon juice, lemonade concentrate, and red wine. Then I mix the carbonated water individually for each drink the next day. Makes for a wonderfully refreshing summer drink! ",

I made pretty much exactly as is except i omitted the cherries and the triple sec. i also omitted the sugar as the lemonade concentrate is sweet enough for my tastes. W/out the sugar and triple sec, its the perfect amount of semi-sweetness...not too much as to not be refreshing but just enough to make it a treat. I took the suggestion of adding the soda as i was serving it for a little bit of fizz. I made with Carnitas for a going away dinner - guests were very impressed as this is a very \"fancy\" yet easy beverage to serve - very fun! Can't wait to make again. ",

I just happen to keep Cointreau in stock. For the brandy I use Wild Cherry brandy. I omit the sugar completely. I mix it all up, then let it sit for about 18 - 24 hours. Then I take a glass, fill it with ice cubes, fill about 1/3 to 1/2 of the glass with Club Soda, then top it with the Sangria. Oh My Goodness...it is the best! I would have never thought that using club soda would be my preference, but it most definitely IS. I made a triple batch for the Fourth of July (only 4 of us total) and I had to make another triple batch the morning of the second day, or we would have run out. Try this recipe exactly as it is written, and then you can easily make any adjustments you prefer. However be forewarned, you need to plan ahead a wee bit, because if you let it sit over night, or even 4-6 hours, it is much much better. Everything seeps and melds together and mixes just wonderfully.I think that is the secret to this particular Sangria recipe. ",

I used a low cost merlot and cherry brandy, skipped the sugar and offered seltzer on the side for anyone who wanted to add it. I quadrupled the recipe so I would have enough to last the entire gathering...which I didn't! Many asked for the recipe before departing the event. I have made it since using apricot brandy, which was also wonderful. I will caution you that if you have left-overs, remove the fruit. If it sits more than a day, the skin's give it a bitter aftertaste. An excellent summer-time offering! Thanks for the recipe! ",

I also used an inexpensive Shiraz for the wine and let the mixture sit in the fridge for about 36 hrs. (After doing some online research regarding which type of wine to use, I found out that Sangria was originally made with inexpensive table wines to enhance their flavor, which makes complete sense and did the job! I can't see using an expensive wine just to doctor it up?!) I added Ginger Ale right before serving. Myself and my guests highly recommend this recipe! ",

You really can't go wrong with the fruit combos. Made this the day before the party (a must in order to allow all flavors to blend and fruit to marinate) but come day of the party totally forgot to add ginger ale and carbonated water (I was going to make two batches to see which was more popular among the guests), but the drink was a huge hit even without the fizz!

I am not a wine drinker so I did a little research and ended up using 2 large bottles of Shiraz Cabernet and quadrupled the recipe. The only thing I left out was the lemon juice, I had only bought one lemon to slice up and since I used the frozen lemonaid I figured it would be ok. I also took note of some of other comments and added some cherry juice. I made this the night before and added the ginger ale before serving. The Sangria got raving complments, it was the hit of the party and there was not a drop left! Definitley a keeper, I can't wait to make this on a warm summer night!! ",

I usually make it exactly as written, minus the club soda, but I have used different fruit combinations, changed the amounts of sugar and/or juice based on what I have, and it still comes out perfect. I think the key is the balance between the brandy and the triple sec...mess with that and it doesn't taste quite the same. One thing is for sure is that you and your guests wil be loaded and happy. One reviewer said \"dangerous\" and \"excellent\" in reference to this recipe. Agreed and agreed. ",

Not sure if it's because I used fresh-squeezed orange juice -- the oranges weren't the sweetest or tastiest, so maybe that's why. I'm going to try the white peach sangria. Maybe that one would suit me better. ",

I used Carlos Rossi Sangria... will definately make again. oh, and its super strong when its freshly made, so letting it sit as long as possible is key in blending the flavors and toning it down. ",

Be particularly careful measuring out the frozen lemonade as it changes the sweetness of the recipe dramatically. Think about making two batches and letting them marinate with the sliced fruit overnight. My first batch was gone really fast! Definitely worth purchasing the hard liquor. ",

Put it all together the night before (except for the soda, which I used Sprite and added as we drank it) and let it marinate. Used suggested fruits and added red grapes. So good! Packs a punch. Will be the standard I use from now on! ",

I cut down on the amount of sugar used and opted to add all of the cherry juice from the maraschino cherries for extra sweetness...yummy! I also decided to add apples as well but found that it is best to add them right before serving so that they do not soak up all of the alcohol (they were pretty potent the first time I made this recipe and allowed the apples to soak overnight). By far the BEST Sangria recipe I have come across. Thanks for sharing!! ",

I've made this many times over the past year or two and anytime I bring it to a party, bbq, whatever there is never any left and I always get requests for the recipe. I use cheap red wine (usually Trader Joe's 2-buck-chuck merlot) and usually use a peach or apricot brandy, and in a pinch I've used peach schnapps in lieu of the triple sec (hey, whatever works, right?!), and aside from the listed fruit I'll also throw in oranges, frozen or fresh strawberries, basically just whatever I have on hand. It's worth the ingredients and the time it takes for the flavors to blend. Yummy-yum-yum!!!!!! ",

I used cheap box red wine (which is why I made sangria in the first place). We didn't like the box wine, but it would've been alcohol abuse to throw it away, so I found this recipe to save it. It worked!!! Thanks! ",

I add a little extra lemon juice and half the triple sec and make a simple syrup with the sugar, as it mixes together much better. I also marinate the fruit int he punch 12-18 hours, then \"muddle\" to get the extra pulp and juice - discarding the rinds before they add bitterness to the sangria. I buy the Taylor Lake County red in the BIG bottle (less than $12 at Walmart) - and it is great. Be sure to drink on a full stomache, as this has quite a kick! ",

I did not add the sugar, and used 7up instead of soda water (again, I was trying to work with what I had on had). I tasted it when I first put it together and I questioned the recipe, but after having a day to mellow out it was outstanding. I made a double batch and everyone went back for seconds (at least).

We made several gallons of this stuff and all of our guests were pleasantly tipsy and throwing their money out the window by the end of the night:)We also used ginger ale. I got to say that it's not your traditional Sangria so if that's what you're looking for then maybe this recipe isn't the one for you. But I'm not a huge fan of red wine to begin with, so adding all the other liquors and gingerale made it a bit sweeter for me. ",

Never had sangria before this, but I'm sure nothing else will compare. I've tried this by the recipe, and also using the peach schnapps / rum swap - both are delicious, though I don't prefer triple sec quite as much. The first couple times I made it with Red Cat, bc that's the only type of red wine I know I like... however, after reading many reviews, I tried the cheaper red wine and it tastes just as delicious !!! No need to use the more expensive wine -- I'd save that for drinking it by itself. This sangria is fantastic.. thanks for the awesome recipe. PS -- guests love eating the cherries after they've been soaked for a day ! ",

Mmmm...I omitted the sugar and served with ginger ale and seltzer water optional. It was a hit! Not a drop left. I also sliced half of the oranges in rounds but put in the rest in edible chunks and they were delicious. I was a little short on brandy (used a 750 mL bottle, which was a little less than a cup short of what was called for) and I doubt that it made too much of a difference. Would definitely make again!

I definitely like the addition of carbonated water for a 'summer' feel. We used one with citrus flavor. Absolutely wonderful. It's almost impossible to ruin this recipe. Next time I'll try a few variation and make a 'white' Sangria. Yum! ",

I say this for two reasons; one, everyone at the brunch I was at commented on how great it tasted (I eased dropped of course); two, everyone was hammered but giddy! The only thing that I really did somewhat different...add strawberries with the other fruit. Also, most important of all is be sure to let the fruit marinate overnight (8hrs) and don't add any soda to it, yet). I waited until I arrived at the brunch and then added 7-up to it. This way, it had a little bubble flavor to it and the soda wasn’t flat sitting in the fridge overnight! The apricot brandy was good additive! 7 gallons of this stuff makes for some really good stories out of people you’ve never met! ",

I took the advice of another reviewer and used peach schnapps instead of triple sec. I didn't use any cherries, but instead added blueberries, kiwis, and pineapples. However, the pineapples were a bit iffy. I guess they have some kind of special digestive enzyme in them and so they will do weird things to the sangria if you use a lot or if you add the juice as well. I did both of these things once but it still tasted fine, just smelled a little ripe. I made sure it was consumed the very next day. Also, I think the cabonated water or 7-up really ruins this drink. Try it without or let people choose if they want to add it or not. ",

OMG we let it sit in Fridge for 48 hrs. and what a difference 1 more day can make. We did really like the Malbec Sangria it had a different flavor. ",

As other reviewers suggested, I used Sprite (instead of sugar and carbonated water) to sweeten. I also used some of the maraschino cherry juice to sweeten it, as well. I didn't have oranges, but I cut up some strawberries to add. You can easily drink a lot of this because it does not have a strong alcohol taste. Be careful not to drink too much; the next day is a bit rough. :) ",

I used peach schnapps instead of triple sec, and instead of the traditional citrus, which makes it bitter if you leave it in too long, I drained a can of Dole tropical fruit, pureed it, then added it to the sangria, I also added about half of the juice. I sweetened with about 2 T sugar, and 1/4 c maraschino cherry juice, since the cherries just sink to the bottom anyway. I added the club soda to the glasses as we drank it...AWESOME!! ",

Used Cap't Morgan's pineapple rum, cheap grocery store merlot and pineapple/orange juice instead of plain OJ. For fruit used: oranges, limes, lemons, strawberries and cherries. Soaked fruit overnight in the rum and sugar and added the wine and OJ a couple of hours prior to serving. Definitely a keeper. I started another batch of fruit soaking but didn't need it so I put it in a large ziploc bag and tossed it in the freezer to thaw and make another day. I plan on using it this weekend! ",

I followed the suggestions of eliminating the sugar and using Ginger Ale as a carbonator, added gingerale to the glass at the end, didn't work. Added the 1/4 c. of sugar and it didn't help much so when the brige group arrived, I dumped the 2 cups of Ginger Ale in the pitcher with the mix. There were no 2nds asked. Didn't expect any to be leftover but it is 'marinating' in the refrigerator and I will probably throw it out. Oh, I did use a good wine that I would drink. Too sour, even with sugar, and too lemony and fruit didn't look pretty, like Helen's. ",

            "Review": "A very forgiving recipe! We made this last night for a party, and everyone enjoyed it. (We made it last for an Easter gathering, with boisterous reviews.) Last night, one person switched from white wine to the Sangria and never went back! We made three changes because we think we are \"Sangria Aficianados.\" We omitted the cherries and carbonated water, and added 1/2 cup Peach Schnapps, and substituted diet 7-Up for the water. Aside from the basic bones of this recipe (the wine, oranges, lemons, limes and specified liqours), many variation work. Apples and Pears work. We always add Brandy and Triple Sec and use 7-Up, but if something is not around or we run out, we find substitutes. I have friends who add dry fruit to their Sangria. (I think it is sweeter, but tasty. They used dried mango and pineapple.) This is really a great ice breaker at a party of friends or acquaintances. ",

I also had to improvise because I realized I didn't have the brandy OR the triple sec I though I had. SO, instead I used burbon and orange flavored tequila that I had on hand. Instead of the sugar I used sweet & low and added extra as I like my sangria just a little bit sweeter. I marinated overnight (including the cherries) and it was the single best sangria I'd ever had. I did NOT add the carbonated soda as it was perfect without. I took the rest over to my dad, the sangria affectionado and he also proclaimed it the best ever....and we fought over the 'marinated' cherries. If I can make it with tequila and burbon and still have it be phenomenal, how would it be if I followed with brandy and triple sec???? I need to find out! I removed the fruit on my second batch--after leaving the citrus slices in for 48 hours my first batch started turning bitter. This is definitely the new party drink at our house! ",

I made a double batch and used 2 oranges, 2 limes and 2 lemons per the recipe. Next time, I'll use one of each for a double batch just to save space in the pitcher and glasses. Also, I recommend halving the orange slices so they fit in the glass better. Will definitely make again! Thanks! ",

As some reviewers suggested, I omitted the sugar and used ginger ale in place of the carbonated water. I also added apples, peaches and plums. I made a pretty big batch and am happy to say it disappeared. Yummy! ",

I used rum instead of brandy and peach schnapps instead of triple sec. In addition to the lemons, limes, oranges, and cherries, I also added pineapple chunks. I omitted the lemonade concentrate and sugar, but added some of the cherry juice. I let it sit overnight. Also, I did not add carbonated water or soda to the Sangria, but had it on hand. When serving, I mixed half gingerale with half Sangria in the glass for most people, but some of our more seasoned drinkers preferred it by itself or mixed with Red Bull. The pineapple did NOT taste good when eaten, so I won't add it next time, but the oranges and cherries were to die for! Great recipe! ",

Also, instead of sugar, I added a big jar of maraschinos with the juice, plus the recommended amt of soda (I used Sprite Zero.) If I did it again I would only slice up one each of the citrus fruits-- I sliced about 4 of each and even that was too much perhaps because I served it in a beverage jar with a spigot at the bottom, instead of a punch bowl or pitcher, so people didn't have access to the fruit. I had about 40 people at the party and the sangria was a big hit. Thanks for the recipe and for all the suggestions! Will definitely make again! ",

I used Cointreau for the triple sec because I'm a snob and prefer it. Didn't have frozen lemonade, but did have pineapple sherbet, used two scoops. No cherries, so I splashed in some grenadine. My only mistake was that I didn't DOUBLE it for four people. Oh and I added an extra peach. The fruit was yummy over frozen custard later. burp ",

Served this tonight for a Cuban-themed dinner for six friends and the two batches weren't quite enough, so we hit a bottle of red wine after we ran out of the Sangria! I loved the brandy and triple sec and don't think I'd substitute those. I omitted the sugar and added Diet 7-UP instead of carbonated water. Even the red-wine hater asked for more!! The best new recipe I've gotten in awhile - thanks!! ",

However tempting it is to start pouring early, you're cheating yourself if you don't wait at least 24 hours. If you can hold out for 36, even better. This stuff gets better the longer it sits in the fridge. ",

The flavors from the sliced fruits really come out after the Sangria sits overnight. I doubled the recipe and it nearly made two quarts. I am not a maraschino cherry fan so I left those out. If you would like, you could add a little club soda to your glass to tone it down for those who cannot handle the stronger flavors of the alcohol. My husband liked this and thinks I should make it again. I concur! Great drink for warmer weather! ",

I typically use a sugar cube and some water with bitters. Also make sure you get large ice cubes for this drink. They dont melt as fast and water it down. I would never use a full orange slice. This isnt a screwdriver. Instead a hint of orange goes a long way with a simple twist of the orange peel over the glass then put the twist in the drink. Also luxardo cherries are a MUCH better choice for this drink. A little pricey but well worth it. As an added bonus if you want this drink smoked, use wood chips on a safe surface, light them on fire with a blowtorch, then place your glass over the wood chips to catch the smoke. While the glass fills with smoke, make your old fashioned and transfer it in to the smoked glass. ",

            "Review": "This sounds like a pretty standard old fashioned, and the way I used to make it. Now I use all fresh fruit, and it is the best ever. I combine several dashes of bitters, a fresh cherry (cut in half, remove bit, then squeeze some juice into glass and add remaining cherry). A slice of orange (a small amount if the juice is squeezed in, then twist the rind to get the oils and essence). Several ounces of bourbon (or rye, etc, but I love Makers) sugar/simple syrup (I prefer sugar in the raw or a cube, it will bring good flavor) add a splash of water and stir. You get good bourbon flavor, with just a touch of the sweet and the juice to cut it. If you are making something like an old fashioned you need to taste the bourbon, if you don't want to taste it go get a vodka red bull, or a wine cooler. ",

I bought some Jameson whiskey for a dinner recipe and had some leftover and decided to try a classic cocktail. This tasted like straight whiskey on ice. I tried to modify it by doubling and then tripeling the simple syrup, doubling the oranges and squeazing them, and then adding in a couple of splashes of the cherry juice from the jar as others suggested. It made it more palateable then, but it still tasted too strong to drink. I wish I wouldn't have spent the extra money now on the bottle of bitters now. It couldn't be tasted anyway. I don't know what to think? Maybe, I just don't like whiskey? Hmmm ",

            "Review": "For those who don't enjoy this drink some tips i've discovered. You can easily use margarita mix instead of lemon or even sour mix. I've found most pre made sour mixes are not made well and while margarita mix is arguably similar if not the same thing it does seem to make a difference. For the raspberry-flavored liqueur you really should use Chambord specifically. It's expensive but maybe start with the nips if you can find them but it makes a world of difference. Cheaper alternatives like razmataz do not have the specific flavor profile needed. Also, this could be me but it needs to be ice cold! if it gets warm in any way blegh. Pretty much this is a raspberry long island iced tea, easy to make and a punch in the face for sure.\nOther than that if you don't like it then all good. We all have different tastes and can change any cocktail we want to fit it. This is the traditional recipe tho, play around a bit. ",

I had the pleasure of bartending for a few years and this recipe they came across on a trip to NYC years ago. We would put it in a frozen drink machine and make it in large batches. So GOOD... plus perfect for the whole day and night poolside. I miss you all. Best group of people you could have had the opportunity to serve. ",

I like a great dirty martini from time to time and almost always get them when I'm out at a restaurant. I decided to try one at home but checked online first to see what people had to say about making them. After several searches, this recipe seemed to be the best to me. I made it as stated in the recipe. After reading the reviews I opted to use the brine from my favorite olives since I'm addicted to them versus using the brine from quality olive jars. I use Goya brand olives with minced anchovies in a can from my local store. I like the saltiness and there is NO fishiness with these olives. The brine makes a fantastic mixer for this recipe. It may be because I'm now on round two but this is probably the smoothest dirty martini i've ever had. It is very important to use a high quality vodka and vermouth!! I do use a piece of cooked bacon as my swizzle stick (see photos) to increase the interest in this drink but I'm not sure that's necessary. The next time I make this, which will probably be over the weekend, I will be sure to get blue cheese stuffed olives with the bacon swizzle stick and the Goya brine. Happy sipping!!!! ",

I love vodka martinis and have made them with many kinds of vodka and many kinds of olives. If you want a simple, but potent, vodka martini, stick a bottle of Belvedere in the freezer for at least a couple of hours, or if you're on a budget use Stolichnaya (Stoli) - yes, I know Stoli isn't cheap. When you put the vodka in the freezer, stick a couple of martini glasses in there as well. To make the martini, place a few Manzanilla olives on a skewer in the frozen glass, add about a 1/2 teaspoon of olive juice, and fill the glass with the vodka from the freezer. It goes without saying, you need to like vodka to enjoy this drink, but if you do - this is one sweet way to drink it. BTW, since there is no ice to melt and water down the vodka, a couple of these goes along way. Before everyone says, why not just fill a glass with vodka and drink it? Well, that would make it a vodka shot, which is also good! ",

To the \"seasoned bartender\" who gave the advice about coating the glass with the vermouth and discarding excess -- thank you!! While the vermouth does lend a definite layer of flavour,I have had other martinis where the vermouth was just too overpowering (and am actually never sure what a \"dash\" constitutes in ANY recipe!) Wonderful tip! As for the olive brine debate, I think if you use the brine from olives you enjoy for yourself and are pleased to set out for company on a tray -- that's perfectly fine -- it's all about personal tastebuds, right? The described portion was a bit much for me so I halved it -- but this will definitely become a regular before-Sunday-night-dinner-drink (as I relax in-between cooking and serving Sunday night dinner! LOL) ",

The Margarita substituted tequila, with lime and salt being the traditional accompaniments. Then the mongrelization began. When I came upon the Margarita in the 70’s, it had been reduced to cheap tequila, bar mix and a pound of ice to be processed in a blender: an adult Slurpee. Follow the above recipe as if your life depended on it. Use a quality tequila, Cointreau and fresh squeezed lime juice. Triple Sec has always been used by bars as a cheap substitute for Cointreau, but they don’t taste the same. As far as turnbot’s use of an eggwhite, you are on your own. A Margarita is a cocktail, not the breakfast of champions. ",

I'm not a fan of \"straight up\" style margaritas, so I'll always have mine with lots of rocks (ice), or blended. If you want a really frothy, truly PERFECT margarita...

It tasted like I had just poured a bunch of powdered sugar in a mug with hot cider or water. It's a good base for a buttered rum batter - but definitely cut the powdered sugar by half, and add a bit of apple pie spice. It also lends very well to using a 50-50 mix of spiced & coconut rum. ",

I used the hot water...mistake. I had to double the batter in my drink to make it not so watery. I used a regular size coffee mug and I finally added whip cream and extra cinnamon and nutmeg to make it ok. But this will go good in my coffee in the morning- so not a total waste. ",

FYI for our Christmas party we heated up a crockpot on low with the mixture and water (1 part mixture, 3 parts water) + add your own rum. What a hit! We refilled the crockpot 3 times! ",

            "Review": "This is the best hot buttered rum batter recipe I've ever come across. The vanilla ice cream is a great substitute for vanilla extract and makes a nice creamy texture and flavor. I prefer to make it without the confectioner's sugar, because I prefer my hot buttered rum more spiced and less sweet; I also added allspice and ground clove for the aforementioned reason. For an awesome twist, we used Captain Morgan Jack-o-Blast; pumpkin spice rum. This recipe probably made enough to last us for at least six months. 10/10, will definitely make again. ",

Not sure if one tablespoon is really enough for one mug’s worth... maybe if you’re using cider it is... but not with water... or maybe just for me since I like it a little sweeter. With water I use a LOT more. This time I used a special our local dairy had for the Xmas season... Eggnog Ice Cream. Since eggnog has a lot of the same spices called for here it is fantastic!!! OMG. I’d say better than the vanilla. I almost left out the cinnamon and nutmeg but decided to stick it in after all. Could’ve left it out probably since the eggnog ice cream is so flavorful. It is so good. We take a thermos of this snowmobiling to keep us warm. It’s a hit!! Mixed up and put in the thermos it stays hot for hours. Perfect way to warm up. Thanks for this wonderful recipe!

I just made another batch where I cut out the step of softening the ice cream by just using a carton of eggnog in place of the ice cream. Even more amazing. Definitely make it as written the first time as a baseline, but then there's lots of room to experiment. If you find the final drink too sweet, just use a little less batter next time. Also, I prefer dark rum to spiced. I make my hot buttered rum with Kraken and it's like heaven in a mug. ",

I used Captain Morgan's Spiced Rum and Crem Brule coffee creamer with hot water the first time. I tried it with hot coffee (without the rum) this morning, but now that it's 5:00 \"somewhere\"... Love this!! ",

An acquaintance was impressed and asked for the recipe, but was disappointed. The only difference I could tell was that she used salted butter. This year I was using the remnants of a former years nutmeg, and that decreased the fragrant aroma. It is great in coffee as well! ",

I halved the recipe and tried it with half the rum amount and totally without the rum. I really like it best without the rum. What a wonderful way to warm up on a chilly night. The mixture doesn't completely freeze, so it is very easy to serve. With half a recipe, I got two full 1 pound containers. ",

I kept going back and forth over less sugar or more butter but ultimately decided to follow the recipe exactly. I used cider instead of water, and Capt Morgan's and I loved it. It wasn't too sweet, had just enough rum to add flavor, but not so much you're gagging on the alcohol taste. I didn't care for nutmeg sprinkled on top, but I did love a dollop of whipped cream on it. Tomorrow I plan to try it with water and maybe whipped cream and cinnamon on top! ",

Each person that had a cup asked for the recipe. I hate to share it...I feel special having such a fun treat for everyone. I used Spiced Rum for each drink, and the kids loved it with cider. I wasn't as big of a fan with the cider. I used Vanilla bean ice cream. I will make every year! Thank you for sharing! ",

It could have something to do with the standard coffee mugs these days being much larger than they used to be. Once I added two tablespoons of batter, I was in heaven. ",

This is absolutely delicious! I don't like a bunch of spices and all of the others were too flavored with nutmeg or cinnamon. This one is so creamy and yummy! All of my friends have asked for the recipe and I find neighbors knocking on my door for a cup when the weather is nasty! :) ",

The batter will never freeze completely solid--don't be alarmed when it keeps a thick gelato texture after hours or days in the freezer. Also, the sprinkled nutmeg at the end makes all the difference. I will be remaking this batter/hot drink every holiday season. ",

You can change it up simply by using a different type of vanilla ice cream (french, vanilla bean etc...) or adding a bit of pure vanilla to give it a richer flavor. The recipe is very versatile. Use it in coffee, with hot water or in cider for starters. I've used rum (spiced IS best) Baileys Irish Cream, coffee and whiskey and yes, even plain ;) This recipe is simply.....NUUUUMMMMY! I made a triple batch and am giving it away in jars for Christmas. THANK YOU SHERIMA1!!!! ",

My husband made it for me last night and I will tell you it made me sleep like a baby! I felt so warmed up and helped loosen my sinuses enough that I could get some decent sleep. Not saying it's a cure all for what ails you, but it sure can't hurt! Plus it tastes sooooo good! I plan on making more of these on xmas! thanks ",

I mixed the batter with Captain Morgan's spiced Rum and it taste so much better than using regular rum.

If anyone has ever had the Sbux Spiced Apple Cider/Caramel apple spice (what ever its called) - this is almost a dead ringer for it. Every fall and winter I always order these at Sbux - it's my absolute favorite and I'm so so so happy I can now make these at home when ever I please. Thank you for this wonderful recipe :) ",

The only danger is eating spoonfuls of it when I am making it! I add a little extra cinnamon, but that is because I love cinnamon so much. ",

Also, tried a non-alcoholic version......2 TBSP batter and 8 oz hot Apple Cider. Very yummy!**UPDATE: Substituted Rum with ButterShots (butterscotch schnapps)...WOW, its hard to decide which is my favorite. This has become our favorite eve drink while wrapping gifts. ",

I had remembered having a hot buttered rum years ago when I was very sick and decided to give this a try and I just can't say enough good things about it. I made it just as directed. Used an 8oz cup so it wouldn't be too watered down. Put the cool whip on top and sipped it non stop. Needless to say since I am not a drinker I was in bed almost immediately hehe but everyone should give this a try. Fantastic holiday drink or just anytime you need something to make you rest comfortably. Thank you so much for sharing this awesome recipe! ",

Less mess, easy to scoop after it's been in the freezer and everything still melts together perfectly when adding the hot water. I also use 2 big scoops of batter, depending on the size of the cup.

I used an instant cider pack and a lot of hot water in a big mug with about a shot of spiced rum. I added a bit more rum because I couldn't taste it. I gave up the idea I would \"taste\" it after I'd added about 2 shots (total). Dangerous stuff! I had my husband whisk the sugars into the butter because the butter was floating and . . I'm a wimp. Once it was whipped it was smooth and almost fudge-ish. Taking an idea from comments in another HBRum recipe on here, I sprayed some ice cube trays with unflavored oil and am freezing pre-portioned amounts for serving to guests. I've never made this before, and only had it once. I'm trying to decide who are the people who *must* get these as gifts and how many I can keep! Update: Don't do the ice-cube tray idea! I've got a gloppy mess! ",

I've noticed that on some of the Buttered Rum reviews people mentioned the \"butter\" floating on top. Because butter is dairy based it shouldn't do this, make sure you don't replace it with margarine- oil based. Also, I doubled the recipe and put it in a plastic gallon ice cream container, it fit perfectly. Make sure you don't put it in a chest type deep freeze while it hardens though. My kids tipped it and dumped half in the full freezer as the seal didn't hold and I didn't notice until 6 hours later, what a mess. ",

I will not be making this again. ",

I added a little extra spice to my taste. My spices were a bit old so that certainly could have contributed to the blandness that I experienced. Once I added it to water the spice really came out anyway. I made it in advance for Thanksgiving and don't have rum yet, so I used rum extract for flavoring. It's so amazing! I'm in heaven right now.

I use about a tablespoon and a half per 6 ounces of water and it comes out nicely! Of course I did not make the whole recipe. I made probably about 2 cups of the batter all together because the recipe makes a BUNCH! ",

I think I might possibly double the spices next time around, but otherwise this is wonderful. I think the people who complain about it being syrupy are letting it sit out at room temprature for too long. I keep the stuff in the freezer, and when I want some, I boil a mug of water and scoop a couple tablespoons of this into it, which cools it just enough to drink right away. Then I just throw in a little bit of rum. This is a great after-ski drink, and a nightcap as well! ",

I gave batter away to two different friends and still had tons left over. It is so darn good, we even warmed it in the microwave and poured it over vanilla ice cream as a sauce, yummy ! ",

My relatives were skeptical at first--they'd never even heard of hot buttered rum--not like this stuff, anyway! It was a very gloopy recipe, but man, was it worth it! One person decided to try it, and soon enough, I was busy making cup after cup of this stuff! A1 stuff. I chose this particular recipe out of the other buttered rum recipes because this included spices. The spices were wonderful, gave it an intoxicating aroma, and worked really well with the quality dark Jamaican rum I chose to use. All the rum and sugar gave me a whopper of a headache, but I'm not complaining! Well worth it! ",

What I will do next time is soften the butter then cream in the brown sugar Then add the powdered sugar and ice cream, and spices. I also gave to my kids by heating up apple cider. They loved it. But I thought it was sweet and rich, so next drink I think I may mix some cider with hot water, then add the batter. YUMMY!!! Also good added to a cup of coffee. ",

Toss in a cinnamon stick and top with a dollop of whipped cream and dash of cinnamon if you really want to look like a goddess. ",

Served over ice instead of mixing in blender - this was just easier for a large group. Everyone loved it the drink was a big hit! ",

You can pour over ice or add ice if you want a slushy type drink. This how they make it in the Bahamas. Substitute the word part with oz , cup ,pint or whatever. ",

I don't love slushy bahama mama's, so I just mixed it together in my cocktail shaker and then poured it over ice. I would definitely make this again! Excited to try it again with the coconut rum and the orange pineapple banana juice that some reviewers mentioned. ",

Depending on the size of the batch I make, I always check on them in the morning to see if they need time to thaw a little, but it saves alot of time and aggrevation of dealing with a blender! I also add a bag of Dole frozen fruit(peaches/mango/pineapple) to them! ",

It was the first legal drink I enjoyed as well, and I just decided to try my hand at making them myself. This recipe is top-notch, however I did substitute the plain rum for some pineapple rum.

I like mine with just a dollop of maraschino cherry juice and a big chunk of mint. This is considered the Hawaiian Mai Tai, which is the post-1953 version made popular by Elvis. Decent drink but not a real Mai Tai. ",

You definitely have to watch how much Malibu you put in because the coconut overpowers the sweeetness and tartness of the drink. I’ll be making more for sure! ",

I do think it is a MUST to add amaretto in this as well to get the almond flavor that Mai Tai's have. Also half of a freshly squeezed lime is great in it as well! I like to add the lime and amaretto in it to make a more authentic tasting Mai Tai, but this recipe is for sure still great as written. Thanks for the recipe! This will be added to the list of favorites. ",

A kick!! But by the next day this drink tasted like the BEST sangria, and I knew immediately I should have made more lol!! Will be remaking this recipe real soon!! ",

So for a Friday easy dinner at their place I made this with tequila rather than brandy, all the citrus and apple. Then threw in strawberries, because I had 3 packs in the fridge. It only got an hour in the fridge so hadn't really developed fully. But sure went down well, the dogs loved the apple pieces, and even ate the orange peel. I need to make again. ",

I misread the recipe and thought it called for only 1/2 cup of rum … I actually used 3/4 cup and that was plenty, especially since I now see a lot of reviewers are complaining that the rum is overpowering. Also, in my opinion this doesn't need any sugar at all. So 4 stars because of too much rum and sugar, but after cutting back on those ingredients I would give it 5 stars. Also, I made ice cubes with fruit-flavored sparkling water to keep the mixture cold without diluting the flavor too much. ",

I used Marques de Caceras Cranzia tempranillo with overproofed Wray and Nephew rum as the alcoholic bases, and they interacted quite well with each other. The thing is, it didn't even taste very alcoholic. It really snuck up on all of us. However, if you're going to go the tempranillo route, I do not recommend going the riserva or gran riserva route, or with any well-oaked wine for that matter. You're going to want a dry but fruity red. Oak is not going to add to this recipe, because it focuses heavily on fruit flavors. ",

I also made the sangria all at once & put it in the fridge for a few hours. I was a perfect amount of alcohol. I recommend adding ice to your glass. It was a refreshing drink on a hot Florida day. Ill definitely make this again. ",

I did use the blackberry merlot and cut the sugar in half as some suggested. I went through two pitchers of this in an afternoon and had requests for the recipe. I will definitely make this again next year...and I probably will make it even sooner. ",

I typically substitute a double bottle of wine which yields more and the taste isn't compromised. Also, it tastes better if you let the fruit soak the rum overnight. Definitely make a double batch because it will be gone by the end of the night! That said, warn your guests that it packs a punch. I've had a few people stand up at the end of the night unaware of the affect. Great for patio parties - happy summer! ",

Poured in 1 cup of Rum and 1/2 cup of Sugar, and left it to soak for 2 hours straight in the refrigerator. After 2 hours, I took them out and added half a bottle of wine followed by a cup of Orange Juice. The end product was just amazing with the Sangria looking blood-maroon in hue. Must try! ",

I read reviews and used the recommended spiced rum and a big cheap bottle of blackberry merlot. I only had 3/4 cup of rum left, so I added a little cointreau to make a full cup of liquor. My fruit (lemon, lime, apple, strawberries, pineapple) soaked in the rum/cointreau/sugar/orange juice all day, and I added the merlot before bed last night. I also poured in some ginger ale before serving for fizz. Everyone loved it. My aunt said it was the best sangria she's ever had. Thanks for the recipe! Will use this again for parties for sure. ",

I used two oranges sliced in rounds, a lemon, a lime, three different types of apples, about 25 strawberries sliced, and a pair (I needed to make a huge batch). I put all of the fruit in a container, put about three quarters of a cup of sugar over the fruit, and then added 2 cups of very high-quality spiced rum. I let that soak in the fridge overnight, and then in the morning, I poured about a cup and a half of orange juice and three bottles of wine over the fruit and rum mixture. I let that sit in the fridge for another couple of hours before the party. I served it with ice on the side, and everyone loved it. Couldn't get enough of it!! Because of the high quality rum, no one has a headache today either. :-) ",

I use brandy & a splash of triple sec or OJ, maybe a splash of peach schnapps, allow it to blend/chill for several hours or overnight. I've also used blackberry brandy as well as ginger brandy for kicks - comes out great. I prefer to serve it with club soda - or ginger ale for those who prefer it sweeter. Again, sorry, but I'd skip this recipe and Google Sangria...you'll find brandy is much more authentic than rum. But hey, whatever works for ya! Also, add any citrus LAST ~ all fresh citrus turns bitter after a couple hours. Cheers! ",

To me, sangria is a year round drink, but most like it as a summer beverage. I love it with rum, like this recipe calls for, but a neutral spirit like vodka works just as well. I'm from Texas, where we like things either really sweet, or really spicy, so I double the sugar. Aside from that, if you're in a hurry, you can really just throw all the ingredients together at once and serve it over ice (which you should do anyway). If you're having a party, go ahead and do yourself a favor and make double the amount. Some people like a splash of 7up to top off their glass. ",

It made a little too much for my pitcher but looked very pretty and was yummy chilled. This was the first sangria I've made and it was very easy. ",

I MADE A SECOND BATCH OF SANGRIA WITH SPICED RUM AND A MIXTURE OF RED / GREEN APPLES AND PEARS. WOW! ALTHOUGH MY HUBS PREFERS THIS WITH MERLOT, HE REALLY LIKED THE FRUIT. THAT'S SAYING A LOT SINCE HE PRETTY MUCH HATES ANY AND ALL FRUIT! :) Pretty good! I am not a wine drinker at ALL, but I really enjoyed this (especially with spiced rum)!!! Having said this, I do think this could use a touch more sugar. Had I been able to find the blackberry wine I wanted to use, this might have been sweet enough for my liking (I had to use Merlot instead). Next time I'll be sure to plan ahead so that I can stop at another grocery store to look for it. I will also substitute pears and apples for the citrus fruits since my hubby thinks they would soak up the booze better lol. Thanks for sharing your recipe, Lisa. I can't wait to make this again - and again! :-) ",

I also used more fruit including strawberries, peaches, oranges, maraschino cherries,apple, pear, lemon and extra lime. Also, it's tastes soooooo good with all that fruit, the sugar is just completely unnecessary, so I didn't use any at all. And I soaked the fruit in rum overnight as suggested by others. (And yes, the fruit tastes amazing after soaking, so don't let too many people taste-test it before adding to the sangria!) I also used orange juice ice cubes in the glasses as suggested by someone else. My guests raved about it and it was all gone in no time! As per the recommendation of the staff member at the liquor store I used Jackson Triggs Merlot red wine and it was delicious. I will definitely be making this again! ",

Also added some apricot brandy (about 1/2 cup). I had some leftover limeade made up as well so I added that (about 2 cups -- note: this was NOT substitued for the OJ -- that was added as well.)

My main qualm is that what makes the sangria taste good--the citrus fruit--is annoying once you go to drink it. Do you strain the slices? Do you eat them? Eating them makes a mess. Next time, I think I'll make this sangria the same way, but before serving it to guests I'll strain out the citrus slices and throw in only edible fruits, like pineapple, apple, or cherries. I don't know how that will affect the taste, but the experience might improve? ",

I used the spiced rum, but we didn't like the blackberry flavored wine (that was recommended by others) as much as regular wine (we used a cheap merlot the first time). I think the blackberry wine works great if you don't have time to let the flavors develop - or if you want a drink that is not as strong. Still, the great thing about this recipe is that you can experiment with the ingredients (both alcohol and fruit) and it'll still taste great. ",

Everyone, yes everyone LOVES this recipes. I save it and use it for all the spring, summer, fall parties I have! Good for drinking by the pool also! Now: January 2016: I make this for EVERY party I have: at least 3 times a year. This time I edited this way: and I must say: even more raves! I quadruple it: which is easy with allrecipes.com calculator on each recipe! Instead of orange juice use FRESH grapefruit juice (in the produce section). Instead of oranges: use red grapefruit slices. I use SPICED rum. Decrease the sugar by a 1/4. Two big pinches of salt (brings out the citrus flavor). For only 6 servings I would use a small pinch of salt. I always use a Cabernet wine. Okay to add an extra bottle of wine to stretch punch. Just keep tasting, as you add, before you add the slices of fruit. Keep muddling the fruit...the more the fruit is bruised in the punch: I think the better it tastes. I would say the punch today is the best yet. And I have made it at least 18 times! ",

I used blackberry wine as others suggested, but still added a bit of sugar. I didn't use quite as much rum (I used Cpt Morgan) since I had some older ladies who were worried about too much booze. I also had 7up on the side if anyone wanted to make a spritzer. For fruit, I used a whole lemon, 1 orange, half of an apple and a half of a can of pineapple with the juice. We actually ended up with leftover fruit, so next time I might not add as much. The drink would be great without it! ",

This also eliminates the need for the 1/2 cup of sugar since the Blackberry Merlot is a sweetened wine. I like using spiced rum such as Captain Morgans. I soak the fruit (I usually add strawberries) in the rum several hours before putting the other ingredients. A bonus is getting to eat the rum/wine soaked fruit afterwards :) Very yummy, there are never any leftovers!! ",

I mixed up the rum, fruit, and sugar the night before and added the wine a couple of hours before serving. The only issue I had was in trying to get the sugar dissolve. Awesome recipe, though. Will be making again. ",

I lower the octane a bit by reducing the total the rum amount to just over 2 cups, and the OJ to about 1.5 cups. Otherwise, the (junk) wine flavor gets lost. I like it better when it's all balanced.

I love making it in the summer to have around for those lovely, lazy afternoons... I add a little more rum, triple sec, a bunch of fruit and mix everything together in one pitcher, letting it all chill in the fridge. Adding a couple of pieces of fresh fruit to each glass is pretty but not necessary. And I never dilute it. Ever. If you are making this in advance (which I recommend), after a day the fruit takes on that red color. So, if you are going for pretty, changing out the fruit before presentation is a good idea. ",

            "Review": "YUM!!! I did make a few changes. i didn't have any oranges so I justed used some orange juice concentrate to take the place of both the juice and oranges. I added lemon, strawberries and a little canned pineapple. I also added some of the juice from the pineapple which is sweet so I only added about a 1/4 cup of sugar. I also used about a 1/2 cup triple sec instead of all rum just because it adds to the citrus flavor. A great starting recipe you can use to add whatever your preferences are. Would be good with all sorts of different fruits!! ",

            "Review": "I made this yesterday for the World Cup final and it was a huge hit - even the Spaniards here in Texas loved it! Being a Sunday I couldn't buy extra liquor so had to use what I had. I doubled the recipe so hence needed 3 cups of rum - I used 1.5 cups of Bajan Mount Gay and 1 cup of Dark Rum - the remaining half cup was made up with Peach Schnapps (some other Sangria recipes call for Peaches). I used Merlot and omitted the sugar - perhaps the Schnapps made the mixture more sweet as I didn't feel I needed the sugar. I added lots of thin slices of the fruit and chopped additional smaller pieces for use in the glass. I didn't have time to let the Sangria sit for two hours so served it within 30 minutes. It was a huge hit and marinating the flavors together overnight must make this a complete winner. Thank you Lisa. ",

We read the reviews and went with the Blackberry Merlot, and spiced rum that several people suggested. We added plums and apples along with the fruit listed. Yum!!! Big hit with everyone! I put a bottle of Sprite next to the Sangria just in case anyone wanted to lighten-up the rather potent concoction. I also had a big spoon there in case anyone wanted to dip in and get the rum-soaked fruit. ",

I added less sugar as well and it was great. As for the fruit, I added lemon, orange, blueberries strawberries and blackberries. I actually soaked the fruit overnight. It turned out wonderfully but watch out for the strawberries because they stood out above the rest for their ability to soak up the rum. Thanks for the great recipe! So simple and delicious. Will be making this all the time for summer entertaining! ",

I used Tortuga spiced rum and Barefoot Merlot (they support Surfrider Foundation!). This was pretty strong- much better for a night at home than taking somewhere and driving afterwards. Today I only let the fruit soak in the rum for about 3 hours, but next time I will let it soak overnight to get a stronger effect. ",

The important step seems to be the 2-hour marinating time in which the fruit and the rum get \"happy\". I used a white merlot for the wine, and it was well balanced. (I don't care for really dry, woody wines.) Alcohol content is really personal preference, and for me, this recipe had twice as much rum as I'd like, so I will cut the rum in half next time. All the party goers enjoyed thje sangria as well, but most chose to cut it with Sprite or OJ. I will definitely make it again with less rum. Thanks for sharing this :-) ",

I used 2007 Turning Leaf Merlot for the wine, and Tortuga Bay spiced rum. The taste was very smooth and fruity. It was delicious, and it kicked us all in the butt, so be careful how much you drink. It will creep up on you! Thanks for the great recipe and tips from the other reviewers. ",

I used a cheap shiraz and a combo of fresh orange and grapefruit juice becuase thats all I had on hand. I also used some pinapple juice left over from another punch I made that night. Not a big deal. I went used 2/3rds the rum called for in the first batch but went all in for the next round. The fruit looks lovely when it turns red. ",

I have also made it with a $3 bottle of Merlot or a much more expensive wine and there is no difference in the flavor so save your money. Be careful because you can hardly taste the liquor and it will knock your socks off. ",

You can also add any kind of fruit that you like, so it's a very forgiving recipe.

I used cheap burgundy, lemon juice instead of a lemon, pineapple-orange juice (it's what I had), and added some maraschino cherries like some others did. Also, don't let it sit for longer than an evening with all the fruit in it or it gets real bitter (probably from the citrus rinds). But again, it was delicious! ",

            "Review": "Fabulous! My first sangria made and it was an absolute HIT with a very large party. I did read all the reviews and made slight modifications. I went crazy with the fruit selection and skipped on the lemons. I added a lime, an orange, 2 kiwi's, cherries (sliced and pitted - fresh), raspberries (fresh), fresh apricots (sliced), 1 apple (sliced), 1 peach (sliced), and 2 pears (the red kind). I chose for my wine Sutter Home White Merlot. I was very nervous about the wine choice but White Merlot is not sweet like Arbor Mist yet not as \"dry\" as a red table wine/merlot/cab/pinot noir. I still added the sugar and the Orange Juice. Note: I went with a few reviews and used the Bacardi Razz Rum (raspberry rum) and used the full 1.5-2 cups. However, I used that amount with 2 1.5 L bottles of wine so I would agree that if I was making this recipe as originally stated I would use no more than 1 cup of rum. HUGE hit. Brought it to a friend's family party where people were being conservative in drinking alcohol and it was gone within 2 hours flat. The best part (and no-waste part)...we took the remains home (the fruit) and food processed it into a HUGE batch of smoothie for tomorrow night. VERY potent and super yummy. Stay Green! ",

The great thing about sangria is you can use the cheapest dry red wine you can find and, once mixed, it tastes like a million bucks. ",

The only thing I did differently was add a cup of Sprite and used fruit that was in season like strawberries, honeydew, pineapple, and tangerines. I also made one pitcher with a $3 bottle of Charles Shaw Shiraz and another pitcher with a $4 bottle of German red. Both were fabulous. You really have to be careful with this stuff because it tastes delicious and you don't realize how much it affects you until it's too late. ",

I was a little concerned about the \"type\" of wine to use. I ended up choosing a cheap shiraz in one and blackberry merlot (as suggested)in the other and light rum. Note: I did cut the rum to a cup and I shook the rum and sugar first before adding to the fruit. Huge hit! ",

I used fresh cherries and apples instead of lemons. Wouldn't use apples next time. I thought the fruit was too strong and I made about 8 hours prior. In case you are trying to make mass quantities like I was I used a double batch (12 servings) for each punch bowl and it fit perfectly. I made 3 punch bowls (6 batches) for about 17 women. What a hit! They were all talking about me making this \"next time\". lol The orange juice ice cubes were loved. I made Cranberry Sierra Mist (it's new) ice cubes too for a festive look. I also added some pomegranite for a Christmasy look. Be prepared to giggle drinking this:) ",

I used nectarines and plums since they were on sale, but I bet this would be great with pears as well!! I only used one cup of (spiced) rum and it was still strong so I believe the amountin the recipe to be a bit excessive. I followed other reviewer's advice and used blackberry merlot. This was delicious, I cannot comment on the authenticity of this recipe, but it sure does taste good!!! ",

Some restaurants add brandy, rum, and even vodka. My personal favorite is dark rum, but I scaled back the recipe so that there was only 1 oz. of rum per serving. A slightly less potent concoction, but it still packs a punch! I only gave the recipe four stars because I think that it needs a lot of tweaking for individual preferences and I did not care for the flavor that the lemons and limes added. Next time, I will use oranges and peaches, which is the \"classic\" Spanish fruit of choice in my experience. ",

The rum-soaked fruit was phenomenal...even the lemons. Thansk Lisa...this was wonderful! ",

Nevertheless it was a huge hit. I took the advice of others and put some Sprite in it from the start as I was having some non-drinkers. I doubled the recipe and it was still all gone. I only used 1/2 cup rum for each recipe. I thought it was plenty. I also used a cheap Blackberry Merlot. All of my guests were driving so I did not want it pack the punch many people desribed. I plan to make it again for our Super Bowl Party. ",

I used oranges, limes, lemons, strawberries and canned peaches (with 1/2 the can of syrup) as my fruit and let the fruit soak in the spiced rum and sugar overnight until the fruit was nice and drunk. Then I added Simply Orange OJ and Arbor Mist Blackberry Merlot. It was a HUGE hit at our Halloween party and now it will be a staple at every party! People especially loved the drunk strawberries!

I followed the suggestions of others and cut the rum to 1 cup and went out to get the Blackberry Merlot---I had never heard of it before but found it with the wine drinks....think inexpensive screw tops. The amount of rum was perfect but next time I will use a bottle of merlot wine. This wine product is inexpensive but I'm sorry, I didn't care for it at all. I added a little more OJ and 1/2 bottle of merlot I had opened the night before to make it drinkable for us. I'm a merlot fan and next time I will use the wine that I normally buy. ",

I use a fruit punch juice (whatever's on sale), strawberries, limes, bacardi limon with the wine and triple sec. I have also used a chardonay for a little variety. It has to chill all mixed together for at least 2-3 hours. If for some reason you have extra, pull out the lime slices and it usually keeps pretty well overnight. ",

Only make as much as is needed since I discovered it does not keep well overnight. One last note: It looked so pretty in a glass pitcher with all the fruit floating in it. Fabulous presentation too!

The only change was, like many reviewers, I halved the amount of rum. I used the cheapest Burgundy I could find and white rum. It's fantastic, and I like it so much more than sangria made with brandy. Thanks so much for this recipe! If I'm using it so much in the winter time, I can only imagine how much I'll use it this summer! ",

I doubled the recipe, used orange rum and Wild Vines Blackberry Merlot, but still only used 1/2 cup sugar as I put in a small container of frozen, sweetened strawberries. I also put in 1 each kiwi, mango, nectarine, all sliced, along with the orange and lime. My grocery store also carries fresh, already cored pineapple, so I also used that. Eating the fruit after the sangria was gone was a real treat! ",

I also added 2-3 sliced strawberries. I used Bacardi Limon, because that's what I had in the cabinet. (and a cheap Merlot) I think I used slightly less rum than the recipe called for; I didn't really measure it. For those who don't like to taste alcohol in their drinks, this will be too strong, but should be good if you cut it with some lemon-lime soda or ginger ale. (and if I make this for guests I will have some available for them, but I love this as is) I will definitely be making this again. ",

I've made this recipe many times, and have had friends rave about it (and ask for the recipe!) However, I tend to throw in different types of fruit, whatever I have on hand (I find that strawberries, blueberries, and nectarines are fruits that work well!) and use only 3/4 cup to 1 cup of rum. I think the sugar is important to help draw out the flavor of the fruit, as well as crushing the fruit after it has chilled in the fridge. Also, I have found that a cheap blackberry merlot (as earlier posters suggested) works best, in my case, a $4 Arbor mist version! I'm the type of person that does not like to taste the alcohol so with these changes, the resulting sangria is sweet, fruity, and will be gone in minutes! ",

If you want to make this without the 2 hour chill time just fill pitcher with ice, add fruit, then brandy & tripple sec, then wine, then oj splash the schnapps stir with a wooden spoon and you're all done.

I brewed 1 batch to share w/a friend for a BYO club event and realized a 2nd batch might come in handy -might have a friend or 2 that needs to be turned on to something different. I mixed up the first batch the night before the event and fortunately(?) I have to get up early otherwise I might have a couple more glasses. OH, I made this with 2 buck Chuck Merlot from Trader Joes to keep the cost down and not waste a \"good\" wine &Bacardi White (clear) rum -the recommended amount because this recipe doesn't need any added flavor, but any inexpensive white rum will probably do the trick. I added some fresh pink grapefruit to the mix and tomorrow for the party i'll be adding sliced nectarines and strawberries. Sangria is a great change from the norm and the fresh fruit makes for some tasty snacking. Just great to beat the AZ heat. ;) This is definitely a summertime favorite. ",

I changed it a little based on other reviews, and to make it taste more like the Sangria at Cafe Sevila. Use apples!! If they suck up the rum, it's only wasted if you don't eat them! And instead of orange juice, add an orange flavored liquer like Cointreau, or if you really want to knock your socks off... Grand Marnier. This is what Cafe Sevila uses! ",

I used less than 1 1/2 cups of rum (about 1 to 1 1/4 cups) and no one thought it was too strong. I used spiced rum and a $6 bottle of red and it turned out great. Added strawberries, an orange and lime, black plums, and some panned peaches- made for a nice variety of colours. Bottom line: this tastes like you spent a long time on it, but it's unbelievably easy to make! If you like sangria, you'll love this recipe! ",

            "Review": "I recently attended a dinner with a Spanish theme and made this recipe. I thought it sounded horrible (rum with wine? wine with OJ? Yuck) but I wanted to do something authentic. It was a huge, huge hit. Even the beer drinking guys wanted seconds of this. I did not cut it with any flavored sodas as some of the reviews said. I did use frozen cherries, blueberries, lemons and limes. I used merot wine and dark rum. I made two batches and everyone was dissapointed that it was all gone. I would highly recommend this recipe.

I sometimes add half rum and half apricot brandy. I ALWAYS add peaches, strawberries, Kiwi, and sometime grapes to the citrus. Everyone loves scooping those up and eating them after they get to the bottom of the sangria. Don't skip on soaking the fruit in the rum and sugar for 2 hrs, and stir it up a couple of times during that 2 hrs. ",

When the Sangria was gone, I filled the pitcher with the remaining Sprite, so it could \"soak up\" the juices left in the fruit. It was a more \"mellow\" drink, which was needed after finishing the pitcher of Sangria. Thanks so much for this recipe! ",

My grandma even went wild over it. I also soaked strawberrys, pineapple, and marschino cherries in equal amounts of OJ and Rum overnight and that was very, very good as well. I did not add the fruit to the sangria, I put it in a seperate bowl so people could pick out what they wanted. It worked out well. ",

I must admit, however, that I doubled the amount of alcohol to two cups and did not find it overpowering. Some may think there is too much sugar, in which case they can just use a little less than recommended. However, considering it makes an entire pitcher, one 1/2 cup is not an overwhelming amount of sugar. Additionally, the steps could be a little revamped; I find the mint flavour (Canadian here) is absorbed better when it is ground up with the juice of the limes in addition to the sugar. ",

I followed the recipe but didn't use as much lime or mint as directed, although I did quarter 2 limes and halved and juiced 1 more and dropped it in the mix - used maybe 20-25 leaves. I recommend not muddling the mint in the sugar too hard because it shreds the mint into tiny bits that get stuck all over your mouth. I also used some rum in my sugar and mint to rinse out the bowl and then pour into the pitcher. Happy drinking all!! ",

I really do prefer the actual sugar as opposed to the simple syrup recipes, and this one is just perfect. Take my advice and make them ahead if you are serving a crowd. You won't regret it. ",

For the most part, it just tasted like Spicy V-8 Juice, and it definitely needed more heat for me. I added a little horseradish, a little beef broth, more worcestershire, a healthy squeeze of lime juice, and additional Tabasco. I have a favorite Bloody Mary recipe on this site, and although this was OK, I think I’ll just stick with that one. ",

If you measure out the frozen strawberries as indicated (about 6 strawberries weighed), you need the ice because it’s not enough on it’s own. One could certainly double or triple the strawberry amount to reduce the sugar and ice amount, but I tried this recipe exactly as written and it’s wonderfully spot on. Tastes just like it would at a restaurant. I will be making these again. Thx for the great recipe! ",

Next time I make this, I am going to increase the amount of strawberries to at least 5 ounces and I'm going to make a simple syrup with the lime juice, lemon juice and sugar to make sure the sugar is completely dissolved. I blended it for quite a while last time and I still had sugar at the bottom of my glass. I also left out the lemon-lime soda - it didn't seem right to add it - unless you are leaving out the rum, then I would add it in. As far as taste, this was just as good as, if not better than any daiquiri I've ever ordered out... so good! ",

It was the perfect consistency and flavor.. Just enough tartness to stand up to the sweetness of the strawberries & sugar. I am saving this recipe for future use, it's amazing!! ",

And it doesn't matter whether I use fresh-squeezed lemons/limes or use the pre-squeezed juice in bottles or whether I use fresh or frozen strawberries. The only thing that really makes a difference is using powdered sugar rather than regular, since the regular doesn't dissolve or distribute evenly. I'm also liberal with what 4 oz. of strawberries means to me. I've tried this with raspberries, too, and am looking forward to trying it with mangos. Mmmmm! Thanks for the great recipe! ",

We almost doubled the amount of rum (bottoms up!), and the drink still masked the flavor very well.

I recommend sweetening the drink with simple syrup or superfine sugar, as the regular granulated sugar can be a little gritty. Use extra soda instead of rum for a refreshing mocktail. My kids love to drink these (without the rum, of course) in a fancy glass rimmed with sugar and garnished with a lime wedge. Delicious! ",

We always use some fresh and some frozen strawberries. I think he estimates the quantities according to taste, but does use this basic recipe every time. We need to come up with another name for them, though, because the kids have started telling people about how they love drinking strawberry daiquiris! ",

I know he didn't measure the strawberries so he needed to add more liquid. Instead of using lemon lime carbonated sode we used fresca and he ended up using the entire can. It was wonderful! We'll make it again, especially with the fresca. ",

If you have a good blender, blend granulated sugar (alone in the blender) for a good 20-30 seconds and you'll get your own superfine sugar. The rum quantity was great. I would leave out the carbonated beverage, though, because it takes away from the strawberry flavour. ",

If you are above the age of 40, you have probably found a premium vodka you can enjoy straight, or over ice. Use this one! However, if you are in your early 20's and it's more of a challenge just to see how much of the cheapest liquor available you CAN possibly drink and still get up the next day, , then you will definitely want to adjust up the measures of Coffee Liqueur and Cream. I was 20 once. I remember. I'm 45 now and I drink premium liquor at a much slower pace! ",

I used Sprite Zero for the soda. Although my strawberries were very ripe, I did not get the nice red color like some of the photos depict. The second one suited my tastes much better,and I would probably rate my second one a four. Thanks for sharing this recipe, Helena W. ",

I had to add way more ice, at least 3 more strawberries, and more lemon. Partly I think that there was way too much sugar. But also, freeze this when you're done, no matter how cold your products are. If you freeze it partly for a couple hours then blend it, it is slushy. Also, I think lime would be a nice touch, and I will try that next time. This recipe was an okay template, but I definitely changed the proportions. ",

I went easy on the lemon juice too, more can be added at the end if needed. YAY for a recipe that makes 1 drink!

You should replace the lemon lime soda with strawberry daiquiri mix and I would definitely add more fresh strawberries in the recipe. The sugar is not necessary for a daiquiri and should be left out completely and the lemon juice should be replaced with orange juice. You may also want a few more ice cubes to get a daiquiri like consistency. Also, this does not make a very large serving, so you may want to double all ingredients. ",

            "Review": "Like most reviewers I halved the amount of sugar and skipped sugaring the rim of our glasses. I also sliced the strawberries, no need to puree them like some people suggested, and muddied them thoroughly with the lime juice, mint, and sugar. I also used 1 1/2 cups of rum and 3 cups of club soda but left the ratios of everything else the same and let the pitcher rest in the fridge for about 30 minutes. We still got great flavor and then when we made the second pitcher using the lime, mint and strawberry bits left while adding new mint, strawberry, and lime on top. Like other reviewers said, you can totally do this with other berries or cucumber. ",

As a few others have done, I ditched the sugar and replaced with Splenda. Use 2 packs per glass. Upped the lime a bit, added more fresh mint leaves, and 1 large strawberry per glass. You really need to muddle the mint, limes & Splenda first, then muddle in the berry(ies). Totally yum! ",

I didn't measure out everything perfectly, but used this recipe as a guide for the ratios I should pour. I put the ingredients directly into a glass pitcher. I ripped apart the mint leaves so they were big enough that people wouldn't swallow, but not huge leaves floating around. I used lime juice instead of limes, although I if I make again, I'd prefer fresh limes. I also found that if I muddled the mint and sugar together first, then added strawberries and mashed them into the sugar and mint that the flavor was best. On one batch I forgot to mash the strawberries, I just threw them in with other ingredients and the loss of flavor was noticeable. ",

I used the 1/2 cup (4 ounces) of Crabbie's Orginal Alcoholic Ginger Beer and all the other ingredients but added one more: 1 tsp of 'simple syrup' which I made by using a 1:1 ratio of water and sugar (1/4 cup water to 1/4 cup sugar or any equal amounts you choose) then microwaving in a glass bowl (NOT in the copper mugs!) and stirring it to dissolve the sugar. The left over simple syrup should be sealed tightly and refrigerated to be used for other recipes within a week. Adding the sugar makes this a 5-star recipe as it tempers the sour/acid of the lime a bit. ",

            "Review": "The brand / quality of ginger beer makes a big difference. With a 'spicy' to balanced ginger beer, I like to add a splash of simple syrup. I really like Bundaberg, or Seattle's Rachel's Ginger Beer. You can skip the syrup if you pick a sweeter ginger brew. Fill your cocktail shaker with a handful of ice, pour in your favorite vodka, slice and squeeze the lime right in there, add the splash of simple syrup, and shake away. Pour the chilled / strained mix into your copper mug (but a glass timber can suffice), then top it with cold ginger beer and serve. ",

I used 1oz rum because I don’t really like the taste of alcohol too much, since it’s a new taste for me. But after guzzling one drink and making another, well...we’ll see how I react, lol. It’s just so good! It’s sweet, but I like sweet. I also used a lemon for my 2nd drink due to no more lime, and it tastes good that way too. Also, I’ve learned to stir the mixture before adding ice, just so the sugar dissolves a little more. But there’s so much sugar that not all of it dissolving is okay. ",

I went a little adventurous and rather than sugar I do stevia and I got an AHA lime+ watermelon seltzer rather than club soda. So good mom doesn’t drink and she said it was good. Little known fact you can substitute club soda for any seltzer so to make it really boozy one can simply add a Truly hard seltzer or a Bud Lifht seltzer I myself like the kiwi mango truly hard seltzer’s with this mojito :) thanks so much for the recipe ",

I preferred it because I do not like things to be quite so sweet. (Although I believe that 3 packs of Splenda would be equivalent to 2 tablespoons of sugar in sweetening power.) Lastly, I used a flavored rum (mine was Gator Bite satsuma rum) which added an extra dimension. I’m looking forward to trying it with the other flavor rums though it would be really amazing with just regular plain white rum. ",

The husman (too old for \"boyfriend,\" but not married) and I are doing a weekly \"cocktail night\" and this was the featured cocktail we experimented with for Cocktail Night #2. Solid recipe for this drink. I've had way worse at actual restaurants. oh, we used: Puerto Angel white rum, 12 mint leaves per drink, and muddled the heck out of the first 3 ingredients! Cheers! ",

Easy to make, just put 1 cup of regular sugar in food processor for 1 minute... If you are putting fresh lime wedges in, you need the grit of the sugar to assist the muddler to get the oils out of the limes!! Makes the drink even fresher... 2 Tablespoons of sugar is excessive, should be 2 full spoons using proper cocktail mixing spoon... ",

We did this over the christmas holiday which is the Christmas Eve Christmas Day and the day after and I may have put a little bit more rum or what I said extra holiday cheer! But I really enjoyed making this recipe! It's a little hard at 1st and I can be a little time consuming. Then as if you want the right amount of mint oil to give it that perfect flavor. This year in July I was in kabo Mexico and we had mojitos and this recipe is the next best thing to how they make it in Mexico. This is now my go to drink for all parties!!!!! ",

If you pour it from the serving glass to a mixer and back in, the mint leaves should be evenly dispersed throughout the glass. only worth it for guests, otherwise it doesn't affect the taste at all.

I have an entire garden of 3 types of mint (some generic type from the grocery store, spearmint, and peppermint) that is basically devoted to making mojitos. Sometimes I jazz it up and muddle blackberries, blueberries, or a strawberry in with the lime and mint, but it's exceptional as-is. ",

            "Review": "I followed on of the reviews and made a simple syrup to add instead of sugar, and found it perfect. Before I made this recipe, I had also done some research on Mojito´s and found one great tip online, saying not to add lime wedges since the bitter flavor from the shell would come into the drink, so I juiced the lime instead. I made this in a mason jar, so I doubled the recipe, and because I juiced the lime, I used the juice from 1.5 lime, 3 tbs simple syrup and then followed the recipe for the mint, ice, rum and club soda. The mojito turned out a little to strong for my liking, so after drinking a little bit, I then added a little bit more club soda and then it was perfect for me. I would probably add 1 ounce of rum next time (in my case 2 ounces since I double it) so it wont become to strong. ",

It was a great way to control the sweetness. I just lifted or lowered my straw a little. Since you can't really drink to the bottom anyway without sucking up mashed up mint and lime wedges, this worked perfectly for me. I used 4 sugar cubes, muddling 3 with the mint and lime. Perfect. ",

First, I did make a simple syrup. 1 cup sugar to 1 cup water. If you make a big pitcher, you will need a lot of simple syrup. Second, I added more rum than mentioned. Third, I strained some of the pulp from the lime. Instead of the sugar, put some simple syrup and muddle the lime and mint. This makes it a bit tastier. Serve over ice, with lime and mint as a garnish. ",

I muddled the 1 like wedge then added simple syrup and two more lime wedges and muddled again. I then poured that into a tall glass with ice. I used 2 ounces of white rum with 1 squished lime wedge and stirred. I added a little bit more ice then the club soda. For mine I used dried stevia leaves from my garden instead of simple syrup and it didn't change the taste at all. Then again I'm used to stevia. A solid drink for sure. ",

If you are looking for a slightly sweeter/simpler version forgo the sugar v simple syrup debate and substitute Sprite/7up or other lemon-lime soda for the club soda and sugar. Also another *hint* can put together rum lime and mint earlier in the day and then strain for a flavor boost using fresh mint for garnish. ",

Substituting simple syrup as some other reviewers suggested saves little time and detracts from the drink. The granular sugar, with the muddled lime and mint, adds to the sweet and complex texture. Serve with one of those wide straws and you'll want to drink these faster on a hot summer day than you can make them (which are still good without the rum, by the way). ",

A local bartender gave me that tip and all of his drinks have been awesome so that's how I made mine. Also...because I was making mojitos in bulk for a large party, I squeezed the lime juice ahead of time, no muddling, and used a blender for the mint mixed with some of the juice and rum. Let the mix set for several minutes and the mint \"extract\" will come out just as well as if I'd muddled the mint. About 1.5 gallons of mojitos lasted around 30 minutes...people loved them!!! ",

When it comes to making one for yourself or you friends, just use the real granulated sugar or sugar cube. Remember; muddling the ingredients together and especially the lime and mint leaves, require a good friction, grinding motion which you won't get from simple sirup!Whenever you'd be muddling sugar with citrus zests, granulated sugar is the \"secret\", it just requires a little extra effort which I think is well worth it especially when you perform in front of your buddies. Also don't worry about needing the \"real\" Cuban mint....any fresh bunch from your local store or your own yard will do. For a nice change you can even substitute fresh mint with fresh basil. Try it and let me know what you think. ",

Although without the muddler tool itself, I was able to muddle the mint in a glass with a rolling pin and then just squeeze the lime in with a small juicer. I also also used a whole lime instead of half and it tasted great to me. Excellent quick and tasty recipe that is easy to adjust. ",

And since I don't do sugar, or sugar substitutes like Splenda, I used a dash (bigger dash than I meant to) of coconut nectar. I muddled it with my potato masher in a bowl. Anyway, I really enjoyed it. I don't know if others would like it the way I made it, but I liked it better than the few I've had in bars. Thanks!! ",

I went to amazon.com and bought stainless steel mesh tea balls.(about $3.00 a piece) After I muttled the mint I put them in the mesh ball. The mesh ball comes with a chain and a hook. Just put in the glass put the hook on the rim and mint leaves don't float in you glass. I make big batch of these for our summer party and these keep the nozzle on our container from clogging up. ",

I ended up having to crush the 4th lime wedge, add a squirt of lime juice (the plastic one), add more seltzer water and a trickle more rum. In other words a taller drink to cut the sweetness. I bought my own mint plant today just to make Mojitos. I think tomorrow I am going to go buy another one - this time the variety with the fuzzy leaves. I think it will be better. ",

I find that muddle-ice-rum-soda does not infuse the whole drink with the minty, limey deliciousness that I want in a mojito. I HIGHLY recommend using this recipe's directions, but muddling your mint and limes (first mint and 1 lime, then 2 more limes) in a cocktail shaker, then adding sugar, rum, and ice and shaking until your hands freeze! Pour it ALL into a glass, fill up with more ice, and top with club soda. The result is frosty and flavorful. Seriously though, as far as ingredients and proportions, this is now my only mojito recipe. Perfect!!! ",

I just wanted a quick and easy recipe, and this was exactly that, plus it's delicious! It's just like any mojito I've had in bars, so I'm going to stick with this recipe (with the granulated sugar). One evening, I had Malibu coconut rum in the house, so I used that - serendipity! SOOO yummy. ",

            "Review": "DELICIOUS! Light, refreshing and a perfect blend of tart and sweet. After reading a considerable amount of reviews and the suggestions given in another review by the author, Brandy, I believe the key to getting this drink perfect is to be sure to use SUPERFINE SUGAR. I was going to try both simple syrup and the sugar to see which one worked best, but I decided at the store while picking up the mint leaves to check and see if they had the superfine sugar. They did and I bought it. This is definitely the key to adding the sugar easily. I used a mortar and pestle to muddle the ingredients and the superfine sugar just melted into the lime juice beautifully and completely with zero effort. The full dissolving of the sugar meant that it was going to mix into the drink evenly and give the proper amount of sweetness in every sip. I'll continue to use the superfine sugar because it's so easy and quick. I also splurged on a beautiful bottle of white rum called Oronoco and I believe that also made a big difference. My finished drink was smooth, perfectly sweet and tart and beautiful to look at. And I'm sure it's easy to overdo it - this cocktail went down way too easily!I used a swizzle stick and stirred it every now and then to keep mixing the flavors as I sipped it. I felt like I was on vacation. This is going to be my new special summer drink and I'm going to make another one this afternoon since it's so hot outside! Thank you, Brandy! ",

            "Review": "Good, but a few tweaks make a better mojito. First, stay away from the simple sugar as the most helpful comment suggests. I have tried it and liken it to lemonade made in the same manner(I hate it!). I like having some undissolved sugar in my drink. I use a citrus reamer to juice half a lime and crush it into the the mint leaves. If I'm being lazy I use enough bottled Key West lime juice to dampen the 2TBS sugar. Also try using SPRITE (or even ginger ale) instead of club soda. MOST IMPORTANTLY MIX EVERYTHING BEFORE ADDING THE CLUB SODA/SPRITE. Then add your carbonation and give the drink a quick swirl or two. Unless you must know exactly how much alcohol you are consuming dont bother measuring out the rum. After filling my glass near to the top with ice, I simply pour the glass about 2/3-3/4 of the way full of rum. ",

I simply muddled the ingredients in a shaker, added ice, then poured the rum over it. I shook the drink, poured it straight into the glas then added a bit more ice and topped with club soda. There was no sense of granular sugar in it. I used all 4 limes in the muddling, but I rimmed the lime along the glass edge. I also added just a touch of roses lime. I think if you were making quantities, simple syrup would make it easier but it's not required for a couple of drinks if you shake it well. The only downside is that you do get a fair amount of floating mint, but I think that adds to it both in aroma and flavor. ",

I also made a simple syrup to use instead of the sugar, which is how they make it at his bar. Simple syrup is 1 cup sugar and 1 cup water. Let the syrup dissolve in the water over low heat and then allow to cool. These are so refreshing on a hot day! ",

I have been making these for a while now, and waited until I had fresh cut mint to use (instead of extracts, packaged leaves, etc) in order to give it a proper review. As with a lot of recipes, fresh ingredients make all the difference, and in this case take the drink from good to great! The only thing I insisted on doing different was to use simple syrup instead of sugar, to make sure it dissolved/blended well. Proper muddling is also key to bringing out the oils of the mint leaves (found that one out the hard way). Thanks for sharing a great recipe. ",

I use a shaker for this so the agave syrup mixes in. I personally prefer to use a shaker anyway. I put about 4-6 large whole basil leaves and juice of one lime in a shaker and muddle. Then added agave syrup to taste and vodka, along with ice. Shake well. Strain into tall glasses filled with ice. I add a splash of mineral water and garnish with a basil leaf. ",

I like to put a bit of sugar in the glass (tall pint type) with the mint leaves as it helps to pull the oil out of the mint when muddling. I then add mint simple syrup to taste. (easy to make, just add mint to the syrup at the end of your cooking time and let steep for 15 minutes) Also you can use plain water or seltzer or sprite or whatever tickles your palate. These are dangerous and super yum! ",

I played all weekend and the mint flavor just translated better when I used the syrup. I muddled a few mint leaves with 1 lime wedge in the glass for effect, then added to taste the syrup, rum, and lime juice; ice cubes; and topped with club soda. This also cut down on the \"dirty fish tank\" effect of the drink, which never bothered me much but my husband complained about. Fun to make and very refreshing, thanks so much for sharing. ",

            "Review": "Awesome recipe! Made for 20 using conversion with great results but a few logistic changes as couldn't muddle in each glass per original recipe. First, with all the cleaning, separating and muddling of the mint, it takes about an hour of hard work so start early! First, I combined most of sugar with rum and club soda in jug then used remaining sugar to separately muddle mint leaves in about 5 stages (~20 leaves at a time) with lime juice. The sugar and lime really helped with the muddling. Also, I used a juice squeezer rather than muddling for several lime because it just got to be too much work to muddle that many! I finished it about 30 minutes prior to serving and it still looked great. On serving, I added to a glass on ice and added leftover mint pieces for garnish. I got lots of positive feedback on this one. Yummy! ",

Using sugar instead of a simple syrup is also important, because the crystals' grit releases even more of the flavorful oils. I only had lemon-lime soda & no club soda, so I did reduce the sugar. After making & tasting it with the recipe's proportions, I did add a little more lime, mint & rum (personal preference). ",

I'm going to try making the simple syrup with turbinado sugar next time around. This drink is perfect by the pool on a hot summer day. Added: I just made this again with ultrafine sugar and it is heavenly. Two tablespoons of sugar may be too much for some, but it's just right for me. Adjust the amounts of sugar, lime, and mint according to taste. The second time around, I added extra lime and muddled the sugar, lime and mint with the back of an ice cream scoop. ",

I know some will argue simple sugar is a better way to go, but I thought the results were identical. When I made this, I didn't have club soda so I used carbonated spring water and it was a little less tart. I'm going to keep making it with carbonated water. ",

We use simple syrup (equal parts sugar in the raw and water, boiled down) instead of granulated sugar because it mixes with more ease. We also just muddle one half of a lime with the mint (exactly 11 leaves), add ice, measure your rum (we use 2 ounces) and simple syrup, then shake that bad boy to death. Pour into a glass, and top with a splash of soda water. These are crazy popular at my bar. We also garnish these with a stick of sugar cane, but that is strictly for aesthetics. Annoying to make, but so good. ",

This is what we used: 3 Gallons of Tampico Orange drink 3 1.8 qt. cartons of Minute Maid Berry Punch 6 qts. Newman's Own Pink Lemonade 3 1.8 qt. cartons of Dole Pineapple-Orange juice 5 handles of Rubinoff Vodka (we're college students, we're broke) We did away with the white rum altogether, seeing as how it's expensive and low in alcohol percentage. This recipe was enough to feed 50+ mouths with multiple cups, and everybody absolutely loved it and have been literally begging us to make it a weekly thing. Absolutely cannot stress enough how amazing this mixture is; 2 solo cups' worth will have any person with a normal alcohol tolerance pretty buzzed. Again, 7 stars. Awesome. ",

We mixed the alcohol with some melon balls and sliced kiwi the night before and put it in the freezer to chill then added the juices and soda just in time for the party to start. You still may want to provide ice nearby as it was closer to warm later on in the evening. If the recipe is followed exactly you will have a punch that is very close to 8% ABV (or about the equivalent of two lite beers per 12oz cup). Add a 750mL bottle of Everclear to bring it up to 10.5% ABV. Very tasty! ",

We have a diabetic in our family so I made a separate batch for him that included a low sugar orange juice and mixed in a minute maid diet mango drink. For the adults I added in the left over cranberry juice and pineapple juice I had from the cranberry whip recipe I made. For the children I made a separate version (with the cranberry/pineapple juices) but used a carbonated grape juice for the champagne. All were delicious!!! ",

I got a bottle of Moscato D'asti, for about $11 at a whole sale club. It is a regular sweeter white wine I like anyway. It is slightly sparkling, unlike French champagne. And, it is much sweeter than the lower priced dry sparkling wines. I also used a favorite oj without the pulp. The proportions are perfect in this recipe, just follow it exactly. ",

That is the recipe, and I feel there may have been a few times I took it intravenously as well. Such a simple concoction if mixed in the right proportions tastes like the nectar of the Gods, but one spirit out of proportion can have disasterous results. Get the alcohol proportions right in the first two, and all is good. after that, you won't care. If the first tastes off balance, I usually have them add a shot of Roses Lime Juice as the most effective first aid(don't waste it), and watch the second being poured and accurately measured. A word of caution: DO NOT TREAT THESE AS SHOTS. Bad things will happen. ",

Still, you can't wrong w/this mix as stated and for the bartender that gives it 3 stars? Just remember, most bar prepared long island teas taste awful in comparison to this recipe. (Cheap sweet & sour mix? ) Not for certain why the bars usually aren't as good as I use well brands to make and so much better. ",

Everyone talked about this slamming drink and wondered what were the ingredients. Yes this is the REAL thing! My grandmother wouldn't tell me the recipe except in excerpts; I finally got the recipe out of her over the years! I say enjoy but be careful because the smoothness can cause you to forget there is alcohol until you go to move of your seat. LOL! ",

I divided the wine and liquor by five -- 1 bottle of port and 1/5-bottle (5 oz.) each of bourbon and rum -- but used the same amount of spices as called for in the recipe. Put the spices in the percolator basket, turn it on and let it run its cycle. I made this on Christmas Eve. I measured out the ingredients ahead of time so it was quick and easy to make. People loved it, especially the way the alcoholic fumes go up your nose when you drink it. ",

I use the same wine and spices, however, I cut the liquor to one 750 ml liter of brandy. The advice given is very good, use really cheap liquor and wine, the spices completely rule the flavor. I also cook this is a 30 cup percolator putting the sugar, spices and fruit in the basket. I also cut up and use a whole orange. By the time it perks thru its done. Serve from the coffee pot so it stays warm. ",

A truly wonderful drink that will get a lot of comments from those who may not be familiar with it. A definite party maker!!! Skoal! ",

Smirnoff vodka and martini and Rossi vermouth.. was ok.. frankly not my \"drink\" ..to heavy of \"hard\" spirits \" taste.. Whiskey sour more my flavor...like a \"sweeter\" taste with less liquor taste. I can see that just 2 or 3 of these I wouldn't drive..and I'm 6'2' 260.. one was enough. I used 3 green olives with pimentos... And just regular ice cubes out of the tray. ",

            "Review": "Okay for a fair or poor quality vodka. Vermouth take away the gasoline aftertaste. FIRST don't skimp on the quality of vermouth. Even the best vermouth is fairly cheap. The \"Perfect Martini\" = Chill a Martini glass AND store the vodka in a freezer or refrigerator. Fill a steel shaker with ice then pour in a good dose of QUALITY vermouth. Shake once or twice and then pour it out the bulk of the vermouth or until the shaker first just starts to drip (if you like a dry Martini) . Now you have the perfect amount of vermouth covering the ice in the shaker. Pour in 2-3 oz vodka, (If you have the means, Begluga Export or Gold line... or) Use a good quality Vodka (Belvedere, Kettle One, Grey Goose, Russian Standard Premiums, Stoli Gold) Shake slowly so as not to bruise the vodka (infuse with air and ice chips) until you feel the steel shaker frosting up. Dump the ice out of the glass and pour the shaker contents down the inside rim of the glass. I use a 1/4 inch thick lemon rind or if I want \"Dirty\" I go with two Queen olives freshly stuffed with Dutch BlueCheese. Skol! ",

Chili's there had no idea what I was talking about, but states close to Canada like Washington, do make a good one. Not to promote a product because I have no vested interest in the company, but Mott's Clamato rocks the Caesar. It comes in reg. , spicey, pickle juice, everything[has horseradish and spicy] and lime. When you visit Canada stock up and find your fav. I have tried the tomato and clam juice combo in a pinch. IT is pink, cloudy Not a substitute in flavor at all. Season with rim of celery salt or montreal steak spice or just salt and fresh pepper. Garnish with pickled hot green beans, celery, pepperoni, olives or pepperoncini [hot pickled peppers] my fave. ",

            "Review": "The photo doesn't do any justice to this great Canadian Classic! If you use just tomato juice it isn't a Caesar! That's the difference between a Bloody Mary and the great Caesar - Tomato juice vs Clamato juice. You can make it with tomato juice and just add clam juice/liquor from a jar. If you're lucky and have fresh clams use their liquor. Using a lime wedge to rim the glass. Use a plate use Celery salt, Cayenne pepper, Chili powder dip into the mixture. A teaspoon of each would be enough for four glasses. Make a pitcher and rim each glass individually. There no straws involved here, you take a sip from the glass, hence the reason it is rimmed with all those goodies. I was in Louisville, KY recently and asked for a Caesar, they didn't have a clue what I was talking about. Their loss. Hail the Great Canadian Caesar! ",

This is popular in Canada, but know that tomato juice is NOT a substitute for Clamato. This drink is meant to be spicy as well, so beef up the hot pepper sauce (Tabasco is what it SHOULD be made with). As was said in previous reviews, there is no replacement for Lea and Perrins Worcestershire - don't try to substitute - it won't work. Try 2 tablespoons Dill pickle juice, but the clincher is to add a couple of shakes of Montreal Steak Spice. Takes this great drink over the top. ",

I start out with a tall glass rimmed with margarita salt and Add ice. Layer 1.5-2 oz. of vodka (or tequila if you want a \"Mother Mary or you can leave out the alcohol for a refreshing \"Virgin Mary\"), 1/5 oz. Worcestershire sauce, 2 tablespoons green olive juice, a dash of Tabasco sauce, squeeze a little lime wedge in there, add some celery salt and fresh ground pepper to taste, then fill with Clamato. Stir and garnish with lime wedge, celery stalk, and green olives. All done! You can also make this by the pitcher! Did I mention I was a bartender? Enjoy! ",

Needs to be spiced up a lot more, see the others suggestions. I myself like it to be a bit more spicy. I use the Extra Spicy Clamato Juice, put about 10 shakes of celery salt into the drink, use no other brand of Worcestershire Sauce than Lee & Perrins, (others just don't imitate the original Worcestershire, and yes, I came to Canada from England, close to the county of Worcestershire so take my word for it on this one) .... it is a nice drink if you add a pickled green bean or pickled asparagus in it rather than the celery. The celery is a bit dull for such a nice spicy drink. The lime wedge is a nice garnish, but I add lime juice (about 1 tsp.) to the drink itself as well. Also, I add the ice last, not first, it's easier to stir with the pickle (or celery if you insist) as the stir stick. ",

I multiplied the recipe, cut back a-bit on the oranges and added some of my own other spices! The taste was incredible. After simmering the entire pot we added it to our wine and then bottled two cases for friends and family for Christmas! Here’s hoping they love it as much as we do! ",

For the red wine: I used a red blend (Llano signature red: Cab sav, merlot, malbec). I thought this was way too sweet. Also, I had mini mandarins, so I used 1.5 of those instead of 1 orange. In my tasting, I thought some almond would be a nice addition. I added a touch of amaretto to the mug, it tasted good. When I make again, I would use 6 tbsp brown sugar and almond slivers, or 4 tbsp brown sugar + 2 tbsp amaretto. ",

I want to make it again with wine I like, because it was the merlot itself that did not taste good. I hoped the spices would fix that, but it didn't. ",

When finished, add more of the reserved sugar syrup (or not) to taste. Forget Christmas, this is wonderful all year long! Oh, and to give this a Swedish twist, serve with raisins and/or slivered almonds in the mug. Absolutely divine. ",

We made this drink with an expensive bottle of Merlot, then did a second batch with a cheaper brand (Barefoot Merlot...$5.99 a bottle). The cheaper brand DEFINITELY had the RIGHT taste and smell! Reminded us of being at the Christmas Market at Marienplatz in Munich -after the following changes. The things I did different was scale back the sugar to 1/2 cup and used orange juice instead of water (and still used the whole orange) per bottle. Done this way...it's like you're getting the drink straight from Germany! ",

I will still be looking for another good mulled wine recipe. The search continues... ",

I kept getting compliments. That said, I used 2 bottles of cabernet sauvignon by Yellow Tail. I then doubled everything else but may have added a bit more sugar since I didn't measure exactly. The only thing I changed was I used mulling spices that I picked up from the store. I just put those in a large tea ball and let them steep. I also combined all the ingredients at once because I wanted a good portion of the alcohol to burn off. Everyone I know loves this and I give out the recipe pretty much every time I make it. ",

I drank the whole batch in two days, while it was snowing outside. Certainly, this is much better served hot; if you don't drink it quickly enough and it gets cold, it doesn't taste nearly as good. I made this exactly as written. However, the sugar/water mixture didn't get \"thick and syrupy\" within 30 minutes; maybe it's my elevation (6200 feet), or maybe I didn't have my \"simmer\" set high enough. I hope that wasn't a crucial part of the recipe. I also didn't get all the juice out of the orange halves (squeezed by hand), but they were pretty large, so I got a lot of juice anyway. But thanks for an introduction to this kind of drink; perhaps I'll find one that will \"wow\" me someday. Oh, and the wine I used was a 2006 California Shiraz (by Charles Shaw). ",

            "Review": "I made this for friends who were on a float in our town's Christmas Parade. I used brown sugar instead of white, and poured it into several insulated mugs with lids. Everyone wanted the recipe, and it helped them warm up after a night on a float. (I suspect it helped us all *float* home, too!) The only other change was that after the sugar/water/orange peel mixture boiled, I turned the stove off and let it sit while I did an errand. When I returned, the mixture had thickened. Since I used a small saucepan, I heated half of the wine in the microwave then added everything into a large thermos. My husband said he could smell it when the thermos was opened! Oh, since there was already orange juice in it, I also added about 1/2 cup of orange liquer for an extra shot of cheer. Will definitely serve again! Thanks for the recipe. ",

I was hesitant to dedicating a bottle of wine to the effort since the last spiced wine we tried was so overspiced that it seemed like cough syrup. But this was a great balance of sweet and citrus and spicy, all without overpowering the wine. I didn't have an orange on hand so I used juice instead of the water and it came out great, I've already gotten requests to make it again and can't wait to try adjusting levels of cinnamon, clove and sugar for mild variations on the theme. A definite winner! ",

I also tried it the original way, but added an extra cinnamon stick. It is really good when you get the mixture thick. I used local muscadine wine. No matter how it is fixed, it is hard to beat!

I made a triple recipie of this for a party, using Tropicana orange juice instead of the water, and I reduced the white sugar a bit and added just a little bit of brown sugar. It did not get syrupy, but with that much orange juice I didn't expect it would. I tripled the cinnamon sticks, but still only used 10 cloves, and only one orange. For wine, I used 1 and 1/2 bottles of Sawmill Creek shiraz. I added 2 bottles while it was on the stove, and then kept it warm in the crock pot, adding another 1/2 bottle directly to the crock pot (the full 3 bottles wouldn't fit). The porportions worked out perfectly though. Very yummy, and very cozy drink.... will definitely make again! ",

It was gone within 30 minutes, doubling the recipe just wasn't enough (for 16 people). Everyone raved as they downed this rosy-warm aromatic drink. Have back-ups pre-made. The trick I used with the crockpot was adding 2 inches of water, turning it on high with a lid while the oranges/cloves simmered in the oj mixture (not water) to get it nice & hot. So, instead of adding the wine to the stovetop pot, I dumped everything in the crockpot after the oranges were finished simmering. This worked great but I knew I was in trouble when it only filled it halfway. I used Yellowtail Shiraz/Cabernet as someone else suggested. Too good! Will make as often as I can. ",

The citrus tends to get a bit of pulp into the wine, so strain it before serving if you mind pulp. Also, if you're serving this to people who don't usually drink wine, I recommend using a sweet wine like Shiraz -- I used a (dry) burgundy and even with the sugar, the initial taste was quite tart when the wine was served hot. This keeps well refrigerated -- just warm in the microwave when you want to serve it. ",

The only thing I changed was to use fresh strawberries - 3 cups to 1/4 cup sugar - semi froze them and added ALL of them into the blender - which did cut down a bit on the ice...maybe 4+ cups of ice. My Favorite Five (the girls I work with) LOVED them!!! They were so impressed - especially since they know that I have never mixed a drink before in my life....and that has been a long time ;) I mix everything together (except Ice) and freeze. When ready to use I thaw and blend with ice. ",

The people who did not rate them well need to learn that this is the kind of recipe you tweek to your liking. If you think it has too much alcohol or not enough, change the amount! For my preferences, this margharita was perfect. Also, none of us thought it was too sweet. There's enough techila to tone down the sweetness in the other ingredients. Just play with it. If you are worried about the frozen strawberries with syrup being too sweet, use only 4 oz of them and add either plain frozen or fresh berries. It's not hard people. Don't lower the rating of the recipe by several stars just because all of us have different taste buds. ",

We also coat the glasses with sugar instead of salt. Because the drink is so fruity, we make a batch w/o tequila for the kids, or pour them some before adding a little less tequila for our drinks. Also, a good orange liqueur will work as a substitute for triple sec. ",

I happened to have one of those bucket margarita mixes already made, with tequila, etc. But I don't care for the bucket mixture or the texture of the ice when it isn't blended. So I put the frozen mixture in the blender with fresh strawberries and some added ice and voila! I definitely think fresh strawberries make a difference. This will be a weekend regular! ",

My only \"gripe\" is that the strawberry flavor was somewhat lacking (it's very subtle, IMHO). I think I'll tinker with the ratio of frozen strawberries next time to see what I can come up with. :) TIP: Moisten the rim of you glass with a lime wedge or cut strawberry half, THEN dip in sugar (powdered, granulated or large crystals). The fruit does double duty.... Not only does it allow the sugar to adhere to your glass (the fruit \"juice\" is sticky), it also serves as a cute garnish! Thanks for sharing, JTWTECH! You made taco night yum-o. :-) ",

The tequila that I used was Jose Cuervo Gold. I could not find the strawberries with syrup so i used frozen strawberries with sugar. You might also want to add strawberry syrup to make it sweeter. Overall great recipe. ",

I made slight variation keeped the amount of alcohol the same, but used Gran Gala instead of triple sec its higher quality, added 8-12 oz unsweetened strawberries because that is what I had, so I added 1/8-1/4 sugar. And added only 3 oz of limeade. And added enough water so it would blend. It was so popular that we ran out of tequila we made 5 batches so if your having a party make sure you have lots of strawberries, tequila, and ice! ",

I make the mix ahead of time in a pitcher & throw it in the fridge. When it's time for a party - I use my Margarita maker & blend it with ice (makes 3 pitchers of margaritas). It's AWESOME and people ask for the recipe constantly. Thanks so much - it's our go-to party recipe! ",

I did not have strawberries in syrup so I just added a half a cup of suger syrup (1/4 c of water heated on the stove with 1/4 c of suger until the granules dissolve, chilled in the fridge.) I also used fresh squezed limes instead of the frozen concentrate. ",

            "Review": "I could drink a pitcher all to myself! This margarita rocks! I think the frozen strawberries help make it the perfect slushie-like drink. My blender works better if you put the liquids in first and then the ice. I put everything in the blender and whatever room I had left I filled with ice. I made this for a dinner party and went through 3 pitchers! (for only 4 people) Very tasty. Used salt instead of sugar on the rims of the glasses but I'm sure either way is just as good. ",

A full cup of booze goes in with 3/4s of it being tequila so be sure to use a good brand. Very tasty and considerably less expensive then buying the ready to use mixes. MMMMM Think I'll have me another. ",

I've tried ChiChi's blend where you just add ice, and it's just not the same, not even close. This is a great recipe, however I think I may add more strawberries and a smidge less limeade next time.
